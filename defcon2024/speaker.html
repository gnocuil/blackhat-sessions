<h3 class="talk-title">Mobile Mesh RF Network Exploitation: Getting the Tea from goTenna</h3>

  <p class="time-room">Friday at 10:00 in LVCC - L1 - HW1-11-02 (Track 2)<br>  45 minutes | Exploit 🪲, Demo 💻, Tool 🛠 </p>

  <h4 class="speaker">Erwin Karincic </h4>
  <h4 class="speaker">Woody </h4>

<p class="abstract"></p><p>False sense of security in devices that 
guarantee security is worse than no security at all. One device used by 
personnel who require communication security is goTenna Pro radio that 
creates an "off-the-grid" encrypted mobile mesh network.This network 
does not require any traditional cellular or satellite infrastructure 
and they may be found locally in your community. The datasheet says it 
is using AES-256 encryption. Has anyone bothered to verify that it is 
being implemented in the most secure manner? We examined this device and
 found that it was possible to fingerprint and track every off-the-grid 
message regardless of encryption. We also identified vulnerabilities 
that result in interception and decryption of the most secure encryption
 algorithm AES-256 as well as injection of messages into the existing 
mesh network. We don’t just trust what datasheets say, we verify it for 
you. We will explain our testing methodologies and demonstrate 
exploitation in a live demo. We will discuss the operational 
implications of these vulnerabilities and safe ways of using these 
devices that decrease the chance of a compromise. The tools developed as
 part of this research will be released open-source to inform what was 
possible to inspire future research against similar devices. We will 
discuss how we worked with goTenna to remedy these issues.</p><p></p>

<h3 class="talk-title">Where’s the Money: Defeating ATM Disk Encryption</h3>

  <p class="time-room">Friday at 10:00 in LVCC - L1 - HW1-11-03 (Track 3)<br>  45 minutes | Exploit 🪲 </p>

  <h4 class="speaker">Matt Burch

  </h4>

<p class="abstract"></p><p>Holding upwards of $400,000, ATMs continue to
 be a target of opportunity and have seen over a 600% increase in crime 
in just the last few years. During this time, I led security research 
with another colleague into the enterprise ATM industry resulting in the
 discovery of 6 zero-day vulnerabilities affecting Diebold Nixdorf’s 
Vynamic Security Suite (VSS), the most prolific ATM security solution in
 the market. 10 minutes or less is all that a malicious actor would need
 to gain full control of any system running VSS via offline code 
injection and decryption of the primary Windows OS. Diebold Nixdorf is 
one of three major North American enterprise class ATM manufacturers 
with a global presence in the financial, casino/gaming, and 
point-of-sale markets. Similar attack surfaces are currently being used 
in the wild and impact millions of systems across the globe. 
Furthermore, VSS is known to be present throughout the US gaming 
industry, including most of the ATM/cash-out systems across Vegas.</p>
<p>In this session, I will publicly disclose this research, review the 
discovery process, and dive into the technical intricacies of each 
vulnerability. The Full Disk Encryption module of VSS conducts a complex
 integrity validation process to ensure a trusted system state, 
performed as a layered approach during system initialization. 
Examination of the workflow will highlight various deficiencies that I 
will demonstrate through PoC exploitation.</p>
<p>Each vulnerability presented in this session has been observed to 
have a recursive impact across all major versions of VSS and represents a
 systemic ongoing risk. We will explore the root-cause, vendor 
remediation steps, and short-comings thereof – perpetuating the attack 
narrative. In conclusion, proper mitigation techniques and procedures 
will be covered, providing valuable insights into defending against 
potential compromise.</p>

<h3 class="talk-title">Securing CCTV Cameras Against Blind Spots</h3>

  <p class="time-room">Friday at 10:00 in LVCC - L1 - HW1-11-04 (Track 4)<br>  20 minutes </p>

  <h4 class="speaker">Jacob Shams  
  <span class="speaker-title">Ph.D. Researcher at Cyber@Ben-Gurion University</span>
  
  
  </h4>

<p class="abstract"></p><p>In recent years, CCTV footage has been 
integrated in systems to observe areas and detect traversing malicious 
actors (e.g., criminals, terrorists). However, this footage has "blind 
spots", areas where objects are detected with lower confidence due to 
their angle/distance from the camera.</p>
<p>In this talk, we investigate a novel side effect of object detection in CCTV footage; location-based confidence weakness.</p>
<p>We demonstrate that a pedestrian's position (distance, angle, height) in footage impacts an object detector's confidence.</p>
<p>We analyze this phenomenon in four lighting conditions (lab, morning,
 afternoon, night) using five object detectors (YOLOv3, Faster R-CNN, 
SSD, DiffusionDet, RTMDet).</p>
<p>We then demonstrate this in footage of pedestrian traffic from three 
locations (Broadway, Shibuya Crossing, Castro Street), showing they 
contain "blind spots" where pedestrians are detected with low 
confidence. This persists across various locations, object detectors, 
and times of day. A malicious actor could take advantage of this to 
avoid detection.</p>
<p>We propose TipToe, a novel evasion attack leveraging "blind spots" to
 construct a minimum confidence path between two points in a 
CCTV-recorded area.
We demonstrate its performance on footage of Broadway, Shibuya Crossing,
 and Castro Street, observed by YOLOv3, Faster R-CNN, SSD, DiffusionDet,
 and RTMDet.</p>
<p>TipToe reduces max/average confidence by 0.10 and 0.16, respectively,
 on paths in Shibuya Crossing observed by YOLOv3, with similar 
performance for other locations and object detectors.</p>

<p class="abstract"></p><p>Advanced Local Procedure Call (ALPC) is an 
Inter Process Communication method in the Windows kernel. In the past 
few years, Windows ALPC and RPC vulnerabilities have emerged in an 
endless stream. These vulnerabilities are mainly based on TOCTOU file 
operations, memory corruption vulnerabilities in RPC services and ALPC 
syscalls in ntoskrnl. </p>
<p>Windows kernel provides a variety of security measures to ensure that
 the data and context accepted by the ALPC and RPC servers are safe. We 
noticed the attack surface in the security mechanism of the ALPC kernel,
 and we found a security flaw in this mechanism (magic) and successfully
 obtained the system privilege from unauthorized users (defeating magic 
by magic).</p>
<p>In this talk, we will first overview the communication mechanism of 
ALPC and RPC services. We will discuss the details of ALPC and RPC in 
the marshal/unmarshal process that has not been disclosed before. We'll 
also talk about the kernel security mechanism in ALPC syscalls. Then we 
will analyze some historical bugs in ALPC and RPC, and disclose the 
details of the vulnerability we found, discussing how we bypassed the 
security mechanism through a small security flaw in security mechanisms.
 Later we'll discuss the exploitation, you will learn about the multiple
 ways. Finally, We'll make conclusions and share our opinions on this 
attack surface, including some tips and opinions on how to find these 
kinds of bugs.</p>

<p class="abstract"></p><p>Physical security is often overlooked in many
 organizational threat models. An increasing amount of physical security
 devices with smart components are being introduced to the market with 
widespread adoption. This creates an enticing attack surface for 
physical red teams.</p>
<p>Lockers and cabinets equipped with electronic smart locks can be 
found in many places such as offices, factories, hospitals, labs, and 
gyms. With remote and hybrid work increasing in popularity, shared use 
office setups becoming the default. Co-working spaces in offices are now
 commonplace with lockers being installed for employee device storage. 
People generally trust that their belongings will be secure in these 
lockers and entrust the locks with sensitive information, like their 
personal PIN.</p>
<p>Is there a more stealthy way to get into lockers that don't involve using a crowbar?</p>
<p>In this talk we will analyze the vulnerabilities affecting locks 
manufactured by the "global leader in keyless lock solutions," Digilock 
[1]. Digilock has been in the physical security industry for more than 
40 years. What went wrong in the development of these devices and how 
can these vulnerabilities be fixed? We will also discuss several other 
vendors operating in this space and compare findings.</p>
<p>We will demonstrate practical physical and side-channel attacks 
targeting locks that accept a standard PIN and RFID. Learn why it is 
poor practice to reuse the same secret PIN for lockers and safes and 
devices such as mobile phones and laptops (especially if they are stored
 inside the lockers).</p><p></p>

<h3 class="talk-title">No Symbols When Reversing? No Problem: Bring Your Own</h3>

  <p class="time-room">Friday at 11:00 in LVCC - L1 - HW1-11-03 (Track 3)<br>  20 minutes | Tool 🛠 </p>

  <h4 class="speaker">Max "Libra" Kersten </h4>

<p class="abstract"></p><p>We all know it all too well: that ominous 
feeling when opening an unknown file in your favorite analysis tool, 
only to be greeted with hundreds or thousands of unknown functions, none
 of which are matched by your existing function signatures, nor any of 
your helper scripts. This makes the analysis a painfully slow and 
tedious process. Additionally, it sometimes means that the required 
analysis time exceeds the available time, and another file is chosen to 
be reversed instead. Especially when dealing with malware, this is an 
undesired scenario, as it would create a blind spot from a blue team’s 
perspective.</p>
<p>The goal of this talk is to share a tried and tested method on how to
 deal with thousands of unknown functions in a given file, significantly
 decreasing the time spent on the analysis. The example throughout the 
talk is the Golang based qBit family, but is applicable to any kind of 
binary. While this talk focuses on using Ghidra, given its free and 
open-source nature, it is equally possible with other industry standard 
tools. The focus will be on scripts, as well as the creation and usage 
of FunctionID and BSim databases. By combining these, you will be able 
to create your own symbols, and bring them anywhere you go, for any 
language of choice.</p>
<p>While the symbols are portable, an aggregation of them scales very 
well over any number of analysts. As such, this methodology works well 
for individual researchers, but when scaling it for a team of 
researchers, the outcome will be greater than the sum of its parts.</p>
<p>This talk will use (malicious) Golang binaries as examples and 
provide a large dataset of symbols for this language. The scripts, as 
well as FunctionID and BSim databases, mentioned in this talk will all 
be made publicly available at the time of this talk.</p>

<p class="abstract"></p><p>On Fri, 29 Mar 2024, at exactly 08:51:26, OSS
 security received a message from Andres Freund, a software engineer at 
Microsoft, stating he had discovered a backdoor in upstream xz/liblzma 
that could compromise SSH servers. The open-source project XZ, 
specifically the liblzma library, has been compromised by a mysterious 
maintainer named Jia Tan, putting the entire internet at risk. 
Fortunately, this discovery helped us avoid the worst.</p>
<p>But what happened? How long has this rogue maintainer been part of 
the project? Who is Jia Tan? Was he involved in other projects? How does
 the backdoor work? And what should we learn from this?</p>
<p>These are questions we will attempt to answer. First, we will discuss
 the discovery, which is so riddled with coincidences and chance that 
it's hard not to think about all the ones we've missed. Then, we'll 
examine the process itself, from gaining trust within the project to 
deploying the backdoor, dissecting the operating methods and the main 
protagonists. We will also dive into the technical details, explaining 
how the backdoor is deployed and how it can be exploited.</p>
<p>The XZ backdoor is not just an incredible undercover operation but 
also a gigantic puzzle to solve. Beyond the technical background, there 
is a story to tell here, to capitalize on what went wrong and what we 
could improve.</p>

<p class="abstract"></p><p>Meet an attacking MySQL honepot which can 
“Attack the attackers”. In 2023 we have found a CVE (CVE-2023-21980) in 
MySQL that allows a rogue MySQL “server” to attack a client connecting 
to it; attack meaning RCE on the client side. Since then we were 
thinking on how to use it for good. One obvious application is to create
 a honeypot which will attack the attackers. In 2024 we have found 
another RCE in mysqldump utility (CVE-2024-21096), so we have created a 
rogue MySQL server and weaponized it with a chain of 3 vulnerabilities: 
1/ arbitrary file read 2/ RCE from 2023 (CVE-2023- 21980) 3/ the new RCE
 (CVE-2024-21096). With this atomic honeypot we were able to discover 2 
new attacks against MySQL server. Using arbitrary file read 
vulnerability in MySQL we were able to download and analyze the 
attackers' code and then execute an “attack against attackers” using a 
chain of exploits.</p>

server secrets including masked misconfigurations, blind data-structure 
injection, hidden routes to forbidden areas, and a vast expanse of 
invisible attack-surface.</p>
<p>This is not a theoretical threat; every technique will be illustrated
 with multiple real-world case studies on diverse targets. Unprecedented
 advances have made these attacks both accurate and efficient; in the 
space of ten seconds you can now reliably detect a sub-millisecond 
differential with no prior configuration or 'lab conditions' required. 
In other words, I'm going to share timing attacks you can actually use.</p>
<p>To help, I'll equip you with a suite of battle-tested open-source 
tools enabling both hands-free automated exploitation, and custom attack
 scripting. I'll also share a little CTF to help you hone your new 
skillset.</p>
<p>Want to take things further? I'll help you transform your own attack 
ideas from theory to reality, by sharing a methodology refined through 
testing countless concepts on thousands of websites. We've neglected 
this omnipresent and incredibly powerful side-channel for too long.</p>

<p class="abstract"></p><p>Introduced in 2011, HID Global’s iCLASS SE 
solution is one of the world’s most widely-deployed Electronic Physical 
Access Control platforms. HID's iCLASS SE Readers are ubiquitous in 
electronic physical access control and used in most government agencies 
and Fortune 500 companies. The readers can be easily seen and identified
 in almost every form of mainstream media. Almost 13 years after iCLASS 
SE’s introduction, ground-breaking research and technical exploits will 
be disclosed publicly for the first time. </p>
<p>In this talk, we detail the process by which we reverse engineered 
the complex hardware and software chain of trust securing HID’s iCLASS 
SE platform.  </p>
<p>Over a seven-year research period, we analyzed hardware, firmware, 
and software elements the ecosystem, uncovering an unfortunate series of
 pitfalls and implementation defects. These flaws culminated in an 
attack chain that allowed for the recovery of sensitive cryptographic 
key material from secure elements, which have received CC EAL 5+ 
accreditation. This chain resulted in revealing some cryptographic keys 
to the kingdom. </p>
<p>Finally, we provide comprehensive guidance on technical and

<p class="abstract"></p><p>One of the best parts of DEF CON is the glitz
 and glam of Vegas, the gambling capital of the world. Many have 
explored hacking casinos (on and off stage). Unfortunately, it’s just 
not like it is portrayed in the Oceans franchise.. in real life there’s 
much less action, no George Clooney, and it’s a lot harder to pull off a
 successful heist. </p>
<p>Fortunately I’m not your typical hacker, I’m an AI hacker. I use 
adversarial machine learning techniques to disrupt, deceive and disclose
 information from Artificial Intelligence systems. </p>
<p>I chose my target carefully: Canberra Casino. It’s the best casino in
 my city.. It’s also the only casino but that’s not the point.
The casino industry is at an interesting inflection point. Many large 
casinos have already adopted AI for surveillance and gameplay 
monitoring, smaller casinos are starting to make the transition, and 
there’s only a couple of companies in the world that provide this 
software. It’s ripe for exploitation. </p>
<p>In this talk I’m going to show you how I bypassed Casino Canberra's 
AI systems - facial recognition, surveillance systems and gameplay 
monitoring. AI Security is the new cyber security threat, and attacks on
 AI systems could have broad implications including misdiagnoses in 
medical imaging, navigation errors in autonomous vehicles.. and 
successful casino heists.</p>

  </h4>

<p class="abstract"></p><p>In this talk we will explore vulnerabilities 
in Amazon Web Services (AWS) products which allowed us to gain access to
 cloud environments.</p>
<p>Traditionally, adversaries have abused misconfigurations and leaked 
credentials to gain access to AWS workloads. Things like exposed 
long-lived access keys and exploiting the privileges of virtual machines
 have allowed adversaries to breach cloud resources. However, these 
mistakes are on the customer side of the shared responsibility model. In
 this session, we will cover vulnerabilities in AWS services that have 
been fixed and that previously allowed us to access cloud resources.</p>
<p>We will start with an exploration of how Identity and Access 
Management (IAM) roles establish trust with AWS services and cover the 
mechanisms that prevent an adversary from assuming roles in other AWS 
accounts. We’ll then demonstrate a vulnerability that bypassed those 
protections. We’ll cover a real world example of a confused deputy 
vulnerability we found in AWS AppSync that allowed us to hijack IAM 
roles in other accounts.</p>
<p>Next, we'll highlight potential misconfigurations involving IAM roles
 leveraging sts:AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity. These misconfigurations cloud
 permit unauthorized global access to these roles without the need for 
authentication, affecting services like Amazon Cognito, GitHub Actions, 
and more.</p>
<p>Finally, we’ll cover a vulnerability we found in AWS Amplify that 
exposed customer IAM roles associated with the service to takeover, 
allowing anyone the ability to gain a foothold in that victim account. 
We’ll also discuss how security practitioners can secure their 
environments, even against a zero-day like one we’ll demonstrate.</p>
<p>Join us to learn how attackers search for and exploit vulnerabilities in AWS services to gain access to cloud environments.</p>

<p class="abstract"></p><p>The DEF CON community challenges the status 
quo, bringing a diversity of perspectives and ideas to identify hidden 
problems and solutions. While DARPA lays claim to the origin of the 
ARPANET/internet, vast communities of people with different interests 
created its novel components. The DARPA Cyber Grand Challenge helped 
launch the field of vulnerability detection and remediation and numerous
 DARPA Cyber Fast Track program performers continue to contribute to DEF
 CON. </p>
<p>What if current vulnerabilities all magically disappeared overnight 
and critical infrastructure were “safe and secure” for the time being. 
What would come next? </p>
<p>In this talk, Dr. Stefanie Tompkins will discuss the value of the 
hacker community and many of the contributions that have come from it, 
as well as the growth and synergy of the two communities. She’ll also 
explore the question of what comes next.</p>
<p>For a deeper dive into the real-world impacts of DARPA cyber 
technologies, Dr. Renee Wegrzyn, the inaugural director of the Advanced 
Research Projects Agency for Health (ARPA-H), will join Stefanie and a

<p class="abstract"></p><p>The Secure Shell (SSH) has evolved from a 
remote shell service to a standardized secure transport that is second 
only to Transport Layer Security (TLS) in terms of exposure and 
popularity. SSH is no longer just for POSIX operating systems; SSH 
services can be found in everything from network devices, to source code
 forges, to Windows-based file transfer tools. While OpenSSH is still 
the most prominent implementation, it's now just one of dozens, and 
these include a handful of libraries that drive a wide range of

<p class="abstract"></p><p>Endpoint detection and response (EDR) 
software has gained significant market share due to its ability to 
examine system state for signs of malware and attacker activity well 
beyond what traditional anti-virus software is capable of detecting. 
This deep inspection capability of EDRs has led to an arms race with 
malware developers who want to evade EDRs while still achieving desired 
goals, such as code injection, lateral movement, and credential theft. 
This monitoring and evasion occurs in the lowest levels of hardware and 
software, including call stack frames, exception handlers, system calls,
 and manipulation of native instructions. Given this reality, EDRs are 
limited in how much lower they can operate to maintain an advantage. The
 success of EDR bypasses has led to their use in many high-profile 
attacks and by prolific ransomware groups.</p>
<p>In this talk, we discuss our research effort that led to the 
development of new memory forensics techniques for the detection of the 
bypasses that malware uses to evade EDRs. This includes bypass 
techniques, such as direct and indirect system calls, module 
overwriting, malicious exceptions handlers, and abuse of debug 
registers. Our developed capabilities were created as new plugins to the
 Volatility memory analysis framework, version 3, and will be released 
after the talk.</p>

<p class="abstract"></p><p>There are physical markings that are required
 under hundreds of different international laws, some governing 
transport of goods across national borders, some offering humanitarian 
protections on the battlefield, some seeking to protect the environment 
or genetic diversity… What they all have in common is that they’re 
currently represented by visual marks applied to objects.  Many of these
 processes are undergoing “digitalization,” and becoming 
machine-readable, or electronically-signaled. A standards effort 
currently underway in the IETF seeks to create a common global marking 
protocol which would allow open-standards-based devices to scan, 
cryptographically validate, and display the digital versions of these 
marks.  This session will relate the state of the standards effort, the 
scope of markings that have been considered thus far, and seek input on 
security or privacy vulnerabilities which may exist in the proposed 
standard.</p><p></p>

<p class="abstract"></p><p>Sashay away from this talk with the knowledge to perform state-of-the-art espionage, no technical background required.</p>
<p>In the realm of privilege escalation and data exfiltration, the 
physical world quietly screams secrets. We'll demystify the fascinating 
physics behind signals and how various forms of energy--infrared, 
visible, and ultraviolet light, radio, ultrasound, audible sound, 
mechanical vibration, and temperature--can be interpreted as waves that 
unintentionally leak information, even in air-gapped (non-networked) 
systems. We'll observe how air is in fact not an effective gap or 
barrier as radio, light, sound, and vibration excitedly travel through 
it. We'll explore how all electrical signals radiate electromagnetism 
(light or radio) that can be intercepted and how we can reverse this 
process, producing electromagnetism to inject desired electrical signals
 into our target.</p>
<p>We'll delve into historical and seminal side-channel/TEMPEST attacks 
from our friends at the NSA, KGB, and past DEF CON pioneers. You'll 
learn about the essential electrical and optical components combined for
 cutting-edge eavesdropping, including what our target is typing from a 
distance.</p>
<p>While others believe they're obtaining noise, we will extract signal,
 and you'll leave this talk hearing the world in a new light.</p>

<h3 class="talk-title">The Way To Android Root: Exploiting Your GPU On Smartphone</h3>

  <p class="time-room">Friday at 14:00 in LVCC - L1 - HW1-11-04 (Track 4)<br>  45 minutes | Demo 💻, Exploit 🪲 </p>

<p class="abstract"></p><p>GPU security is a vital area of mobile 
security highlighted both by public security research as well as by 
in-the-wild attacks. Due to the high complexity of the GPU 
software/firmware along with a widely available attack surface, issues 
in GPU provide strong exploitation primitives for local privilege 
escalation attacks by the code running in unprivileged context.</p>
<p>In this talk, we will focus our research on the Qualcomm Adreno GPU, 
which is a very popular GPU implementation in mobile devices. We will do
 a deep dive into Adreno GPU kernel module implementation focusing on 
the most recent GPU versions, reveal its complex and new attack 
surfaces, and discuss vulnerabilities we discovered in this component.</p>
<p>In total we identified 9+ exploitable vulnerabilities in Adreno GPU 
driver leading to kernel code execution and affecting Qualcomm-based 
devices using the latest GPU models. We will demonstrate the 
exploitation of one of the race condition issues on a fully-patched 
widely used Android device to obtain root privileges from 
zero-permission application with 100% success rate.</p>
<p>Android kernel mitigations such as CFI and W^X create significant 
hurdles for exploiting vulnerabilities in kernel to achieve code 
execution. Also race condition usually means unstable, low success rate.
 We'll explain how we overcome these challenges with a novel, generic 
exploit method that leverages GPU features to achieve arbitrary physical
 memory read/write. This technique bypasses key mitigations (CFI, W^X) 
and has broader implications for kernel heap buffer overflows. We will 
cover the technical details of the exploitation, and especially the 
novel generic exploit method.</p>
<p>We will also discuss the action items that the vendors could take to 
minimize the impact of this exploit method, as well as general methods 
to improve the overall security status of the GPU.</p><p></p>

<p class="abstract"></p><p>The cloud seems complex, but it's what 
happens behind the scenes that really complicates things. Some services 
utilize others as resources as part of their logic/operation. 
Interestingly enough, it turns out that this could lead to catastrophic 
results if done unsafely.This talk will present six critical 
vulnerabilities that we found in AWS, along with the stories and 
methodologies behind them. These vulnerabilities could allow external 
attackers to breach almost any AWS account. The vulnerabilities range 
from remote code execution, which could lead to full account takeover, 
to information disclosure, potentially exposing sensitive data, or 
causing denial of service. The session will share our story of 
discovery, how we were able to identify commonalities among them, and 
how we developed a method to uncover more vulnerabilities and enhance 
the impact by using common techniques leading to privilege escalation. 
We will then detail our approach for mapping service external resources 
and release our Open-Source tool to research service internal API calls.
 We will also present a method to check if accounts have been vulnerable
 to this vector in the past.We will conclude our talk with the lessons 
learned during this research and our future line of research. We will 
highlight new areas that cloud researchers need to explore when hunting 
for cloud vulnerabilities and highlight best practices for developers to
 use in complex environments.</p>

modern de facto authentication scheme on Windows platforms, supporting 
authentication and encryption backed by biometrics.  In a world that is 
quickly accelerating towards a passwordless existence, what new threats 
do we face in this complex landscape?  We will take a deep dive into the
 inner working of Windows Hello.  Via the release of a new tool, it will
 be demonstrated how an attacker on a fully compromised Windows host can
 leverage secrets backed by Windows Hello biometrics without needing the

  </h4>

<p class="abstract"></p><p>Do you consider the list of mobile apps you 
use and the frequency at which you use them private information? What 
about the GPS coordinates of the cell towers to which your smartphone 
connects? The Android framework restricts third-party apps from freely 
obtaining this information – unless the user explicitly grants the app 
access. Android is a diverse ecosystem that comes with many benefits, 
but device vendors can still unintentionally expose app usage and device
 location in a variety of ways. We uncover privacy leaks of both types 
of data, where pre-loaded vendor software exposes app usage and location
 to co-located software. We also explore various local exposures of this
 data, where it is leaked to resources that do not require any special 
permissions or privileges to access.</p>
<p>We discovered these leakages across several major vendors, including 
Samsung, Nokia, Transsion brands (i.e., Tecno, Infinix, and Itel), and 
additional vendors that utilize a pre-installed Qualcomm app for 
performance monitoring. We cover each of these exposures in detail. App 
usage reveals the subset of the apps that the user actually interacts 
with, which can be collected, combined with location data, and analyzed 
for advertising, profiling, and establishing user pattern-of-life.</p>

well as how to perform their own research to find new attacks should 
attend this talk. We’ll begin by exploring what AI Red Teaming is truly 
about, before exploring Meta’s process and approaches on the topic. The 
team will detail our methodology for discovering new risks within 
complex AI capabilities, how emergent capabilities may breed emergent 
risks, what types of attacks we’re looking to perform across different

<p>The team will then move on to how we used automation to scale attacks
 up, our novel approach to multi-turn adversarial AI agents and the 
systems we built to benchmark safety across a set of different high-risk
 areas. We also plan to discuss advanced cyber-attacks (both human and 
automated), Meta’s open benchmark CyberSecEvals and touch on Red Teaming
 for national security threats presented by state-of-the-art models. For
 each of these areas we’ll touch on various assessment and measurement

organization’s, traditional, “security awareness” mentality into a 
“situational awareness” mindset. Using real-world examples, we 
demonstrate turning potential threats into teachable moments. </p>
<p>This session is essential for anyone looking to harness the power of 
AI in hacking and Red Teaming. We offer practical skills to engage 
employees and enhance your approach to social engineering both 
offensively and defensively. And yes, we do this with a certain theme in
 mind as I ENGAGE the audience as we boldly go where no Hackers have 
gone before!</p>

<p class="abstract"></p><p>A quarter of a million people die from 
Hepatitis C every year. Fifty million people are currently infected, and
 a million more are infected each year. But for the first time in 
history there is a cure (not just a treatment) for a virus, and it is 
for Hepatitis C. Take one 400mg pill of Sofosbuvir every day for twelve 
weeks, and you will be free of the virus. The catch? Those pills are one
 thousand US dollars apiece because the molecule is the "Intellectual 
Property" of Gilead Pharmaceuticals, and they refuse to share. So if you
 have $84,000 USD, Hep C is not your problem. But for everyone else, The
 Four Thieves Vinegar Collective has developed a way to make the entire 
course of treatment for $300 USD. This methodology also applies to other
 diseases. Like any science, the method of manufacture of drugs can be 
replicated, and we are going to give you all the necessary tools and 
show you the process top-to-bottom. Watch it happen live, participate, 
and learn to do it yourself: Use our digital research assistant to help 
you navigate the scientific literature, feed your medicine of choice 
into ChemHacktica to get a chemical synthesis pathway, put that 
procedure into the Recipe Press to generate code for the new version of 
the MicroLab to run, and watch the medicine form in the reaction 
chamber. Finally come on stage, press some tablets, and make your own 
thousand-dollar pill for four dollars in materials. The feds say saving a
 life this way is bioterrorism. We say: So Be It.</p><p></p>

<p class="abstract"></p><p>Knowing where and how your mobile and IoT devices communicate on the Internet is essential for ensuring privacy and security.</p>
<p>In the past, it has been easy to follow their communication through a
 WIFI connection that you control. However, your devices are becoming 
more locked down and utilize mobile networks such as 4G and 5G for 
communication. As the devices communicate directly through mobile 
network base stations operated by Internet Service Providers (ISPs), 
tampering with or even monitoring their communication is outside your 
reach.</p>
<p>While it is possible to set up a private base station, it requires 
expensive components and is hard to operate. However, many ISPs have 
begun offering private Access Point Names (APNs) to allow you to have a 
private network inside the ISP infrastructure.</p>
<p>This talk will show how you can affordably leverage ISP-operated 
mobile networks and their private APN services to control your mobile 
devices' network traffic. This technique lets you inspect, filter, and 
tamper with your mobile devices' IP traffic for offensive and defensive 
cyber security needs, such as penetration testing IoT devices or 
monitoring mobile device endpoints for malicious traffic.</p>

<p class="abstract"></p><p>In a world where technology and software are 
intertwined with our daily lives more than ever, a silent threat grows 
in the shadows.</p>
<p>End-of-life devices—abandoned by manufacturers - power our homes, 
hospitals, businesses and critical infrastructure. From the depths of 
the cyber underground, malicious software from cybercriminal and 
nation-state actors is seizing these forgotten devices and conscripting 
them into botnets and other malicious infrastructure.</p>
<p>For example, Black Lotus Labs revealed a chilling trend: 40,000 small
 office home office (SOHO) routers compromised and enrolled in the 
sinister 'Faceless' botnet - now powered by devices you own and thought 
were safe.</p>
<p>And it's not just routers. Critical medical devices, essential 
security hardware—smart home appliances. No gadget is safe. And, with 
the Internet of Things set to double in the next decade, billions of 
vulnerable devices marketed and sold to connect us risk robbing, 
dividing and defeating us in the years to come: a process one expert has
 termed “enshittification.”</p>
<p>After years of warnings from the cybersecurity community, alarms are 
finally sounding in the halls of power. But more is needed: a clarion 
call to reset, to redefine ownership and security in an age of smart, 
connected devices before it's too late.</p>
<p>In this panel you’ll be enlisted to join the fight. You’ll hear from 
experts working at the forefront of a fight to challenge the status quo 
and seek solutions to safeguard our digital futures.Are you ready to 
stand up for your right to a secure, connected world? The battle for 
control, for transparency- for a sustainable and resilient digital 
future begins now!</p><p></p>

<p class="abstract"></p><p>A lot of security research have recently 
focused on various wireless communication protocols, targeting 
smartphones, wireless mice and keyboards and even cars. In order to 
demonstrate these attacks, researchers developed dedicated tools that 
for most of them include some specialized firmware of their own but also
 rely on various unique custom host/device communication protocols. 
These tools work great but are strongly tied to some specific hardware 
that at some point will not be available anymore, or require hackers to 
buy more hardware to carry on to have fun with. Why not making these 
tools compatible with more hardware ? And why researchers always have to
 create their own host/device protocol when it comes to using a 
dedicated hardware ? Why not having one flexible protocol and related 
tools to rule them all ?</p>
<p>We will present in this talk WHAD, a framework that provides an 
extensible host/device communication protocol, dedicated protocol stacks
 and way more for hackers who love having fun with wireless protocols. 
WHAD makes interoperability possible between tools by allowing different
 hardware devices to be used if they provide the required capabilities, 
giving the opportunity to create advanced tools without having to care 
about the hardware and its firmware in most of the cases!</p>

<p class="abstract"></p><p>Secure Web Gateways (SWGs) are cloud-based 
SSL-intercepting proxies and an important component of enterprise Secure
 Access Service Edge (SASE) or Security Service Edge (SSE) solutions. 
SWGs ensure secure web access for enterprise users by doing malware 
protection, threat prevention, URL filtering, and content inspection of 
sensitive data, among other critical security measures. </p>
<p>Our research indicates that in today's world of complex web 
applications and protocols, SWGs often fail to deliver on their promise.
 We will demonstrate a new class of attacks: “Last Mile Reassembly 
Attacks,” which, as of this writing, can bypass every SWG in the Gartner
 Magic Quadrant for SASE and SSE - this includes the largest public 
market cybersecurity companies in the world. Additionally, we will 
release an open-source attack toolkit for researchers and red teams to 
test these attacks on their security solutions and better understand 
their security exposure.</p>
<p>We aim for our talk to compel SWG vendors to rethink cloud-based 
client-side web attack detection models, and for enterprises to rethink 
how they look at securing their users against web threats. </p>

<p class="abstract"></p><p>Over the past decade, infotainment systems 
experienced a growth in functionality, broader adoption and central 
incorporation into the vehicle architecture. Due to the ever-growing 
role of wireless protocols such as Bluetooth and a known lack of patches
 alongside the difficulty of patch installation, this poses a new attack
 surface and a genuine threat to the users. At the same time, the tools 
and methodologies required for testing are scattered across the 
Internet, absent and need a rigorous setup.</p>
<p>In this talk, we share a comprehensive framework BlueToolkit to test 
and replay Bluetooth Classic vulnerabilities. We provide practical 
information and tips. Additionally, we release new exploits and a 
privilege escalation attack vector.</p>
<p>We show how we used the toolkit to find 64 new vulnerabilities in 22 
modern cars and the Garmin Flight Stream flight management system used 
in several aircraft types.
Our work equips Bluetooth hackers with necessary information on novel 
implementation-specific vulnerabilities that could be used to steal 
information from target cars, establish MitM position or escalate 
privileges to hijack victims’ accounts stealthily.</p>
<p>We believe our research will be beneficial in finding new 
vulnerabilities and making Bluetooth research more accessible and 
reproducible.</p>

<p class="abstract"></p><p>What's it like to spend a career as a 
cyberdefender for the DoD and the nation, but homed inside of an 
intelligence agency?  In this talk, I'll offer a historical and personal
 perspective based on 35 years at the National Security Agency as a 
vulnerability analyst for the defense, from junior analyst to executive 
manager.  The common element across my career was the search for 
vulnerabilities in the name of defense - finding them, making sense of 
them, leading organizations to find them, and then translating that 
knowledge into action to prevent or manage them. I'll share lessons 
learned as cyberdefense evolved from a focus on mathematics and 
cryptography to systems and software; and from government security to a 
global internet. And we'll focus on the mission, technical, and cultural
 interplay of cyberdefense and offense/intelligence as it played out at 
NSA. War stories, culture clashes, bureaucratic mazes? Of course! But in
 the end, better security for all.</p>
<p>Communications Security, Computer Security, Information Security, 
Information Assurance, Defensive Information Operations, and several 
more - I'm very lucky to have ridden the World-Wide Wave we now call 
cybersecurity.</p>
<p>And I am very proud to have spent 35 years in Federal Service at the 
National Security Agency as part of the Information Assurance mission. 
The common element across my career was the search for vulnerabilities 
in the name of defense - finding vulnerabilities, making sense of them, 
leading organizations to find them, and then translating that knowledge 
into action to prevent or manage them.</p>
<p>That final challenge consumed the last third of my government career.
 How can we translate what we learn through product testing, Red Teams, 
Blue Teams, systems analysis, etc. into operational guidance, best 
practices, requirements, training, and security improvements? How can we
 bridge the gap between telling people what they are doing wrong, and 
helping them do what's right? This led to projects like the release of 
NSA Security Guides to the public (www.nsa.gov), involvement in open 
standards for security automation and information sharing, and an 
activity now known as the Critical Security Controls.</p>
<p>Since retirement in 2012, I have been able to continue to serve the 
cause of cyber defense through our work at the non-profit Center for 
Internet Security, and the Council on CyberSecurity before that. And I 
am very active in more volunteer cybersecurity causes than I can recall.</p><p></p>


  <p class="speaker-bio"><strong>Tony Sager</strong><br>
  </p><p>Tony is currently Senior VP &amp; Chief Evangelist for the 
Center for Internet Security (CIS), leading a wide variety of strategic,
 partnership, and outreach activities. He led the work which later 
became known as the CIS Critical Security Controls – an independent, 
volunteer-developed, cyber defense best practices program which is used 
throughout the industry. Tony has led numerous other activities to 
develop, share, scale, and sustain effective defensive cyber practices 
for worldwide adoption. </p>
<p>In addition to his duties at CIS, Tony is a volunteer in numerous 
cyber community service activities: inaugural member of the DHS/CISA

and service on numerous national-level study groups and advisory panels.</p>
<p>Tony retired from the National Security Agency in 2012 after 34 years
 as a mathematician, computer scientist, and executive manager. As one 
of the Agency’s first Software Vulnerability Analysts, he helped create 
and led two premier NSA cyber defense organizations (the System and 
Network Attack Center, and the Vulnerability Analysis and Operations 
Group). In 2001, he led the release of NSA security guidance to the 
public and expanded NSA’s role in the development of open standards for 
security. </p>

exploited in a number of ways. It could be weaknesses found within the 
credential itself, the antiquated communication protocol, the hardware 
itself, or the firmware it is running. But more often than not, it is a 
combination of factors that allow a variety of attacks from multiple 
dimensions. Some are extremely trivial and require little to no skill to
 perform, whereas some attacks require a bit more setup and knowledge of
 how the underlying technology works. We will go into detail on how 
these systems work, why verifying mutual authentication is important for
 physical access control systems and the exploits that can be 
accomplished, as well as ways to mitigate these exploits to make your 
facility more secure. This talk will include interactive demos involving
 official HID readers and hardware, proxmark3, and the flipper zero.</p>

<h3 class="talk-title">Reverse Engineering MicroPython Frozen Modules: Data Structures, Reconstruction, and Reading Bytecode</h3>

<p class="abstract"></p><p>MicroPython is a firmware environment for 
quickly developing and deploying software onto microcontroller systems. 
It is used in a variety of industrial and scientific applications, as 
well as (most importantly) in some DEF CON #badgelife projects. It's 
easy to learn and use for rapid prototyping.</p>
<p>For hackers interested in reverse engineering compiled or obfuscated 
MicroPython code, there are some obstacles. MicroPython is an 
implementation of CPython, not a port, so it has its own compiled 
bytecode language that existing reverse engineering tools aren't 
designed to parse. Also, modules can be "frozen", compiled directly into
 the microcontroller firmware, and may be difficult to locate and parse 
when microcontroller firmware is extracted and analyzed.</p>
<p>In this talk, Wesley will walk the audience through the process of 
identifying "frozen"/compiled modules in a firmware image without debug 
symbols using the Ghidra disassembler. The relevant module, string, 
object, and raw code data structures will be detailed, so that 
everything required to rebuild a non-frozen module can recovered. Once a
 compiled module is reconstructed, Wesley will present a detailed 
example of reading and understanding MicroPython compiled bytecode, for 
the purpose of reverse engineering the purpose and implementation of the
 module.</p>

  <p class="time-room">Saturday at 10:00 in LVCC - L3 - W322-W327 (Warstories Track)<br>  105 minutes </p>

<p class="abstract"></p><p>The year is 1984… Ronald Reagan is President,
 it is a “New Mourning in America.” In Texas, a small cabal of 
malcontents meet in an abandoned slaughterhouse, decorated with heavy 
metal band posters, satanic iconography, and, most ominously, the skull 
of a DEAD COW… As pirated copies of speedmetal and punk music play in 
the background, these erstwhile revolutionaries speak of their 
disillusion with The Way Things Are, and their obsession with their new 
computers. All over America, teens were waking to not just the typical 
dissatisfaction of adolescence, but the awareness that via these new 
modes of communication and interaction, they could meet like-minded 
others, have some illicit fun, and maybe, just maybe, change the goddamn
 world.</p>
<p>1984 wasn’t the beginning of hacking, but brought perhaps the first 
real blossoming of the culture. The spread of the personal computer, and
 the modem, brought the birth of not just cDc, but the Legion of Doom, 
and 2600 Magazine. 1985 would bring Phrack Magazine, and a true 
explosion in the written culture, with t-files becoming the currency of 
the Truly Elite. In this session, members of cDc, 2600, LoD, MoD, and 
r00t will talk about what made them hackers and phreaks, swap stories, 
and answer questions posed by Prof. Walter Scheirer of the University of
 Notre Dame and audience Q&amp;A.</p><p></p>

<h3 class="talk-title">Gotta Cache ‘em all: bending the rules of web cache exploitation</h3>

  <p class="time-room">Saturday at 10:30 in LVCC - L1 - HW1-11-02 (Track 2)<br>  45 minutes | Demo 💻, Exploit 🪲, Tool 🛠 </p>

  </h4>

<p class="abstract"></p><p>In recent years, web cache attacks have 
become a popular way to steal sensitive data, deface websites, and 
deliver exploits. We've also seen parser inconsistencies causing 
critical vulnerabilities like HTTP Request Smuggling. This raises the 
question: what happens if we attack web caches' URL-parsers? </p>
<p>In this session, I'll introduce two powerful new techniques that 
exploit RFC ambiguities to bypass the limitations of web cache deception
 and poisoning attacks.</p>
<p>First, I'll introduce Static Path Deception, a novel technique to 
completely compromise the confidentiality of an application. I’ll 
illustrate this with a case study showing how such a breach can be 
replicated in environments like Nginx behind Cloudflare.</p>
<p>Next, I'll present Cache Key Confusion, and show how to exploit URL 
parsing inconsistencies in major platforms, including Microsoft Azure 
Cloud. I’ll then show how to achieve arbitrary cache poisoning and full 
denial of service.</p>
<p>Finally, I'll reveal how to supercharge these vulnerabilities with a 
live demo that blends Cache Key Confusion with a “non-exploitable” open 
redirect to execute arbitrary JS code for complete site takeover.</p>
<p>Attendees will depart armed with a set of innovative techniques, 
along with a definitive methodology to find and exploit these and other 
URL or HTTP discrepancies.</p>

<p>This is the first time Web Cache Deception attacks were introduced and worked as a starting point for my research.</p>
<p>Web Cache Entanglement: Novel Pathways to Poisoning - James Kettle
<a href="https://portswigger.net/research/web-cache-entanglement">link</a></p>
<p>This research worked as an inspiration to develop the cache poisoning
 techniques. I also used this paper to outline the state of the art in 
web cache exploitation and create a different approach using parser 
discrepancies.</p>

<p>The web cache deception techniques using delimiters for path 
confusion were inspired by the 2020 USENIX presentation “Cached and 
confused: Web cache deception in the wild”. In that presentation, they 
briefly describe some variations of path confusion using four encoded 
characters. Although the objective of their paper was to show a 
large-scale study of web cache deception vulnerabilities in the wild, it
 also introduced the use of delimiters for path confusion. In my 
presentation I'll expand on this concept, providing a methodology to 
find all the delimiters used by a URL parser and explaining how to use 
them in new exploitation techniques.</p>

<p class="abstract"></p><p>It's the holiday season and all through the air,</p>
<p>Messages arrive, not with joy, but despair.</p>
<p>A sinister plot unfolds, a digital dance,</p>
<p>Smishing scammers striking, a threat to enhance.</p>
<p>This past holiday season saw a dramatic rise in SMS phishing 
(smishing) messages, specifically targeting people pretending to be the 
USPS. Almost everyone in the United States received one of these 
messages using a kit sold by the ‘Smishing Triad’. While many of us knew
 these were scams many more did not, including someone close to me.</p>
<p>I knew I had to do something about it once I started receiving these 
texts myself. With my focus in web application testing, I immediately 
took interest in these smishing kits and how I could exploit them. After
 a thorough review, some collaboration with other researchers, and a 
little reverse engineering I was able to find two vulnerabilities in the
 scammer’s kits allowing me to login to the admin panels.</p>
<p>Using this I have been able to recover over 390k distinct credit 
cards that the scammers had gathered using over 40 admin panels and well
 over 900 unique domains. Along with this was info on the scammers 
themselves like login IPs, usernames, and some cracked passwords they 
use.</p>
<p>This talk will cover the technical details of how I reverse 
engineered this kit, found these vulnerabilities, and collected the 
victim and admin data for each of these sites.</p>

<h3 class="talk-title">The Rise and Fall of Binary Exploitation</h3>

  </h4>

<p class="abstract"></p><p>For the past 20+ years binary exploitation 
has been seen as the ultimate challenge and prize, when exploiting large
 applications and operating systems. During this period, the question of
 "How much longer will we be able to do this?" has been asked countless 
times, and with good reason. Memory safety and corruption issues with 
low-level languages have been an enormous challenge for OS and 
application developers. There are certainly efforts to move to "safer" 
languages such as Rust, but those languages need to mature a bit longer 
before they're able to stand up to the capabilities of a language like 
C++. </p>
<p>Thanks to exploit mitigations and memory protections, a large number 
of these vulnerabilities are not exploitable. There are the mature 
mitigations, such as Data Execution Prevention (DEP) and Address Space 
Layout Randomization (ASLR), and then newer ones such as Control-flow 
Enforcement Technology (CET) and Virtualization Based Security (VBS). A 
large number of these mitigations are not enabled by default on the 
Windows OS, due to the fact that many need to be tested to ensure they 
do not break production applications. In this presentation, we will take
 a technical dive into the state of binary exploitation and the 
effectiveness of the many available mitigations, by looking at the way 
they're enforced.</p><p></p>

<p class="abstract"></p><p>Quick Share (formerly Nearby Share) has enabled file sharing on Android for 4 years and expanded to Windows a year ago.</p>
<p>Google's promotion of Quick Share for preinstallation on Windows, 
alongside the limited recent research, ignited our curiosity about its 
safety, leading to an investigation that uncovered more than we had 
imagined.</p>
<p>We studied its Protobuf-based protocol using hooks, built tools to 
communicate with Quick Share devices, and a fuzzer that found 
non-exploitable crashes in the Windows app. We then diverted to search 
for logical vulnerabilities, and boy oh boy, we regretted we hadn’t done
 it sooner.</p>
<p>We found 10 vulnerabilities both in Windows &amp; Android allowing us
 to remotely write files into devices without approval, force the 
Windows app to crash in additional ways, redirect its traffic to our 
WiFi AP, traverse paths to the user’s folder, and more. However, we 
desired the holy grail, an RCE. Thus, we returned to the drawing board, 
where we realized that the RCE is already in our possession in a form of
 a complex chain.</p>
<p>In this talk, we’ll introduce QuickShell - An RCE attack chain on 
Windows combining 5 out of 10 vulnerabilities in Quick Share. We’ll 
provide an overview about Quick Share’s protocol, present our fuzzer, 
the found vulnerabilities, a new HTTPS MITM technique, and finally the 
RCE chain.</p>

<h3 class="talk-title">Sudos and Sudon’ts - Peering inside Sudo for Windows</h3>

  <p class="time-room">Saturday at 11:30 in LVCC - L1 - HW1-11-03 (Track 3)<br>  45 minutes | Exploit 🪲 </p>

  </h4>

<p class="abstract"></p><p>In February 2024, Microsoft announced the 
release of Sudo for Windows for Windows 11 Insider Preview[1]. Like the 
Unix sudo utility, it provides a method for users to run commands with 
elevated permissions. This talk will share the results of an analysis of
 Sudo for Windows, starting with a summary of the information provided 
by Microsoft. From there, we will explore the architecture used to 
coordinate the elevation of the specified process, the ALPC service used
 to communicate between elevated and non-elevated processes, how Rust 
interoperates with Windows APIs, and the path resolution process for 
files and relative paths. As part of that journey, we will discuss a few
 discovered security issues.</p>
<p>This presentation will be valuable to anyone with an interest in 
Windows reverse engineering or Rust memory safety. A conceptual 
understanding of Windows Inter-Process Communication (IPC) and heap 
allocation may make parts of the talk more approachable, but the main 
ideas will be accessible to anyone with a high-level understanding of 
process memory layout (stack vs heap).</p>

<h3 class="talk-title">Grand Theft Actions: Abusing Self-Hosted GitHub Runners at Scale</h3>

<p class="abstract"></p><p>GitHub Actions is quickly becoming the de 
facto CI/CD provider for open-source projects, startups, and 
enterprises. At the same time, GitHub’s security model is full of 
insecure defaults. This makes it easy for their customers to expose 
themselves to critical attacks from the public internet. The end result?
 A systemic vulnerability class that won’t go away.</p>
<p>During our research, we identified GitHub Actions misconfigurations 
at scale that would allow threat actors to backdoor major open-source 
projects. An example of this is our attack on PyTorch, a prominent ML 
framework used by companies and researchers around the world.</p>
<p>Through this attack, we could contribute code directly to the main 
branch of the PyTorch repository, upload malicious releases, backdoor 
other PyTorch projects, and more. These attacks began by compromising 
self-hosted runners, which are machines that execute jobs in a GitHub 
Actions workflow. From there, we leveraged misconfigurations and GitHub 
“features” to elevate our privileges within GitHub Actions workflows.</p>
<p>Our research campaign included dozens of reports, over $250,000 in 
bug bounties, and endless war stories. Tune in for a deep dive into the 
TTPs that allow turning a trivial runner compromise into a full supply 
chain attack.</p>

<p class="abstract"></p><p>System Management Mode (SMM) is one of the 
most powerful execution modes in the x86 architecture and code at this 
level is invisible to the Hypervisor and OS-level protections, including
 anti-cheat engines and anti-virus systems. While the BIOS ecosystem's 
complexity has led to a multitude of vulnerabilities in firmware over 
time, vendors are now making strides in delivering patches with greater 
speed and efficiency. Unfortunately, these efforts are not enough in the
 presence of a CPU vulnerability.</p>

<p>In this fireside chat, ONCD will have the opportunity to introduce 
our 2nd National Cyber Director to the research community and discuss 
some of his priorities, such as space cybersecurity. We will discuss how
 the White House has been working to tackle hard problems and

<p class="abstract"></p><p>As DevOps and developers are slowly shifting 
away from storing long-lived static credentials to the more secure, 
still kinda-new, OIDC alternative - the underlying logic, mechanisms and
 implementations tend to feel like complicated magic and are mostly 
overlooked.</p>
<p>In this talk, we'll begin by recapping what OIDC is, who are the 
interacting entities when OIDC is used, and how OIDC is taking place to 
securely access one's cloud using CI/CD flows.</p>
<p>Once covered, we will be able to alternate our point-of-view between 
the entities in play and demonstrate potential vulnerabilities in 
various setups.</p>
<p>Starting with the user PoV, we will show what "under-configurations" 
look like, and continue by demonstrating how new OIDC configuration 
options can actually be misconfigurations that can result with a 
compromise.</p>
<p>We will then see another attack vector where leaking an OIDC token 
from a single repository in an organization can allow an attacker to 
abuse under-configurations and access private clouds.</p>
<p>After that, we will shift our PoV to be of the Identity Provider 
(IdP) so that we can look into what happens if an IdP is misconfigured, 
and disclose a real-world security vulnerability found in one of the 
most popular CI vendors that allowed us to access any of their 
customers' cloud environments.</p>

<p class="abstract"></p><p>In 2018, a secure communications app called 
Anom started to gain popularity among organized criminals. Soon, top 
tier drug traffickers were using it all over the world. Because they

high stakes crimes across the platform. But Anom had a secret: it was 
secretly run by the FBI.</p>
<p>For years Joseph Cox has investigated the inside story of Anom, 
speaking to people who coded the app, those who sold it, criminals who 
chatted across it, and the FBI agents who surreptitiously managed it. 
This new talk, building on details from his recent book DARK WIRE, will 
include never-before-published technical details on how the Anom network
 functioned, how the backdoor itself worked, and how Anom grew to such a
 size that the FBI started to lose control of its own creation. </p>
<p>It will also reflect on how police have entered a new phase of 
compromising entire encrypted phone networks, with little to no debate

<p class="abstract"></p><p>Ransomware groups have become notably 
proficient at wreaking havoc across various sectors , but we can turn 
the tables. However, a less explored avenue in the fight against these 
digital adversaries lies in the proactive offense against their web 
panels. In this presentation, I will delve into the strategies and 
methodologies for infiltrating and commandeering the web panels used by 
ransomware groups to manage their malicious operations or the APIs used 
during their initial exfiltration of data.</p>
<p>I will demonstrate how to leverage these vulnerabilities to gain 
unauthorized access to the ransomware groups' web panels. This access 
not only disrupts their operations but also opens a window to gather 
intelligence and potentially identify the operators behind those APTs. 
Let’s explore the frontiers of cyber offense, targeting the very command
 and control (C2) centers ransomware groups rely on, turning the tables 
in our ongoing battle against cyber threats,it’s our turn to wreak 
havoc.</p>

realized that only his dog didn’t have an API, so he decided to steer 
his focus towards security.</p>

extra focus on machine learning. He’s still actively pursuing it.</p>
<p>He currently applies his skills as a Chief Technology Officer at

themselves on the internet and get a leg up in security terms.</p>
<p>His love of a simplistic approach to hacking by exploiting vulnerable
 APIs led him to publish research regarding API controlling ships, smart
 locks, IP cameras, car alarms, EV chargers, and many other IoT devices.
 Since our lives are nowadays extremely cyber-dependent, his goal is to 
convince all companies to never neglect their API security as 
rush-to-market mentality is almost certain to lead to catastrophic 
security failure.</p>

  </h4>

<p class="abstract"></p><p>SQL injections seem to be a solved problem; 
databases even have built-in support for prepared statements, leaving no
 room for injections. In this session, we will go a level deeper: 
instead of attacking the query syntax, we will explore smuggling attacks
 against database wire protocols, through which remote, unauthenticated 
attackers can inject entire (No)SQL statements into an application's 
database connection.</p>
<p>Using vulnerable database driver libraries as case studies, we will 
bring the concept of HTTP request smuggling to binary protocols. By 
corrupting the boundaries between protocol messages, we desynchronize an
 application and its database, allowing the insertion of malicious 
messages that lead to authentication bypasses, data leakage, and remote 
code execution.</p>
<p>To put our findings into context, we will explore the real-world 
applicability of this new concept by comparing how robust various 
languages and frameworks are against these attacks. We will also discuss
 how smuggling attacks are not specific to database wire protocols but 
affect all kinds of binary protocols, from databases over message queues
 to caching. We will end the session with inspirations for future 
research to explore the topic further.</p>

<p class="abstract"></p><p>Password managers are routinely granted a 
massive level of trust from users, by nature of managing some of their 
most sensitive credentials. For any noteworthy password manager, the 
encryption standards for user data are well understood and highly 
scrutinized. What is less understood is the attack surface of the 
software itself. This presentation explores the local security of the 
1Password MacOS desktop application and answers the question of “how 
safe are my passwords if my computer is infected or otherwise 
compromised?”.</p>
<p>This talk will cover the outcome of our research into 1Password, 
presenting several different attacks to dump local 1Password vaults. 
This includes describing multiple application vulnerabilities and 
security weaknesses we identified in the 1Password MacOS desktop 
application, as well as discussing the inherent limitations in its usage
 of IPC mechanisms and open source software. Additionally, we will 
discuss novel vulnerabilities found in Google Chrome that aided our

<p class="abstract"></p><p>Trolls cheating in video games by passing 
Tool-Assisted Speedruns off as human effort break leaderboards and 
stifle speedrunners. Why do they do it when they could make a cool game 
hack or TAS to show off their work, and how do you trap these trolls? 
The answer is to use their own tools against them, often with popcorn 
bucket worthy results like taking down Guinness World Records. From a 
TASVideos member taking on 1980's Dragster cheat Todd Rogers, a passing 
mention of Billy Mitchell, and the TASBot team investigating Super Mario
 Maker shenanigans, this talk covers several notable cheating incidents 
and concludes with a systematic takedown of a troll that chilled the

  <p class="time-room">Saturday at 14:30 in LVCC - L1 - HW1-11-03 (Track 3)<br>  45 minutes | Demo 💻, Tool 🛠 </p>

  <h4 class="speaker">Thomas "stacksmashing" Roth </h4>

<p class="abstract"></p><p>With the iPhone 15 &amp; iPhone 15 Pro Apple 
switched their iPhone to USB-C - and introduced a new proprietary USB-C 
controller: The ACE3.</p>
<p>But the ACE3 does more than just handle USB power delivery: It's a 
full microcontroller running a full USB stack connected to some of the 
internal busses of the device, and we even managed to access JTAG on the
 iPhone 15 through it. It also provides access to UART, the internal 
SPMI bus, etc. Previous variants of the ACE, namely the ACE2 found in 
MacBooks, could easily be dumped and analyzed using SWD - and even be 
persistently backdoored through a software vulnerability we found.</p>
<p>On the ACE3 however, Apple upped their game: Firmware updates are 
personalized, debug interfaces seem to be disabled, and the external 
flash is validated and does not contain all the firmware. However using a
 combination of reverse-engineering, RF side-channel analysis and 
electro-magnetic fault-injection it was possible to gain code-execution 
on the ACE3 - allowing dumping of the ROM, and analysis of the 
functionality.</p>
<p>This talk will show how to use a combination of hardware, firmware, 
reverse-engineering, side-channel analysis and fault-injection to gain 
code-execution on a completely custom chip, enabling further security 
research on an under-explored but security relevant part of Apple 
devices.</p>

  <h4 class="speaker">Mikhail Shcherbakov </h4>

<p class="abstract"></p><p>aWe explore case studies of exploiting 
vulnerabilities in modern JavaScript and TypeScript applications, 
drawing on experiences from participating in the Kibana Bug Bounty 
Program. It's not uncommon to encounter a vulnerability that appears 
unexploitable at first glance, or to be told by a triage team that the 
behavior is "by design." So, what options does a security researcher 
have in such situations? And what primitives can be utilized to 
construct an exploitation chain with significant impact?</p>
<p>Our study involves breaking out of properly isolated containers in 
scenarios where there is RCE-by-design. We will examine several 
Prototype Pollutions that crash an application in less than one second 
after exploitation and explore how these vulnerabilities can ultimately 
lead to critical RCEs. Furthermore, we introduce new primitives and 
gadgets that enable the achievement of RCE from Prototype Pollutions 
previously deemed unexploitable beyond DoS attacks.</p>
<p>By highlighting these methods, the talk aims to equip attendees with 
advanced techniques for exploiting complex vulnerability chains in 
JavaScript applications, as well as recommendations for proper defense 
and mitigations against them.</p>

<h3 class="talk-title">A Shadow Librarian in Broad Daylight: Fighting back against ever encroaching capitalism</h3>

  <p class="time-room">Saturday at 15:00 in LVCC - L3 - W322-W327 (Warstories Track)<br>  45 minutes </p>

  <h4 class="speaker">Daniel Messer </h4>

<p class="abstract"></p><p>The public library is under attack. Calls for
 book banning are at an all time high. Some states have passed laws that
 hold librarians legally accountable for offering "unacceptable" 
materials to minors. But before this fire started, another one was 
already burning. In an era of digital content, from eBooks to streaming 
movies, public libraries have been forced to accept draconian terms of 
service at the expense of their patrons and to the benefit of 
corporations. Grossly inflated eBook prices and licensing, unobtainable 
materials that went out of print due to artificial scarcity, exorbitant 
fees for access to academic research; these are just a few of the myriad
 of ways that libraries have been forced to bow before capitalism, all 
because of a desire to serve the public. But we can fight back...</p>
<p>And no one says we need to fight fairly.</p>
<p>I’d like to tell you some real life stories of a public librarian 
with a quasi-legal, dark grey skillset. And I’d love to share some ideas
 about what you can do to help others. If I can do this, you can. And 
anyone can be a shadow librarian.</p>

  </h4>

<p class="abstract"></p><p>In the current digital security ecosystem, 
where threats evolve rapidly and with complexity, companies developing 
Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) solutions are in constant search 
for innovations that not only keep up but also anticipate emerging 
attack vectors.  In this context, this article introduces the HookChain,
 a look from another perspective at widely known techniques, which when 
combined, provide an additional layer of sophisticated evasion against 
traditional EDR systems.</p>
<p>Through a precise combination of IAT Hooking techniques, dynamic SSN 
resolution, and indirect system calls, HookChain redirects the execution
 flow of Windows subsystems in a way that remains invisible to the 
vigilant eyes of EDRs that only act on Ntdll.dll, without requiring 
changes to the source code of the applications and malwares involved.</p>
<p>This work not only challenges current conventions in cybersecurity 
but also sheds light on a promising path for future protection 
strategies, leveraging the understanding that continuous evolution is 
key to the effectiveness of digital security. </p>
<p>By developing and exploring the HookChain technique, this study 
significantly contributes to the body of knowledge in endpoint security,
 stimulating the development of more robust and adaptive solutions that 
can effectively address the ever-changing dynamics of digital threats. 
This work aspires to inspire deep reflection and advancement in the 
research and development of security technologies that are always 
several steps ahead of adversaries.</p><p></p>

<p class="abstract"></p><p>Electronic hotel locks have been in use for 
over three decades, and have become an integral part of the hospitality 
sector. Las Vegas has over 150.000 hotel rooms, many of which use an 
RFID based electronic lock for access control. Most hotel guests rely on
 these locks to safeguard personal belongings and to protect their 
personal safety. However, some of these long-deployed locks have never 
been publicly scrutinized by the research community.</p>
<p>This presentation covers the discovery of vulnerabilities affecting 
three million dormakaba Saflok locks. The Saflok system relied on a 
proprietary key derivation function for its MIFARE Classic cards and a 
proprietary encryption algorithm for the card contents. Reverse 
engineering the Saflok system allowed us to forge valid keycards. After 
reading a single, low privilege, guest card we are able to create a pair
 of forged key cards that allow us to deactivate the deadbolt and open 
any room at the property.</p>
<p>We reported these vulnerabilities to dormakaba in September of 2022, 
as part of this presentation we will discuss the responsible disclosure 
and mitigation processes. Additionally, we will demonstrate how you can 
determine if your own hotel room has been patched to help ensure your 
personal safety.</p>

  </h4>

<p class="abstract"></p><p>Presented by Jake Jepson and Rik Chatterjee, 
two Systems Engineering Master's students at Colorado State University, 
this talk delves into the critical security implications within the 
trucking industry, particularly focusing on Electronic Logging Devices 
(ELDs). These devices, integral to compliance with Hours of Service 
regulations, present unique cyber-physical threats due to their 
networked nature and lack of standardized security protocols.</p>
<p>The presentation will walk through examining potential remote 
exploits via wireless ELD compromise, leading to cyber physical control 
payloads and even wormable scenarios. Key vulnerabilities identified 
include insecure defaults and poor security practices shown on a 
commercially available ELD. These vulnerabilities not only expose truck 
networks to potential unauthorized control but also highlight systemic 
issues in device certification and security oversight.</p>
<p>The talk will cover their journey from acquiring and reverse 
engineering ELDs, discovering their common architectures and weaknesses,
 to demonstrating proof of concept attacks that underline the urgent 
need for industry-wide security reforms. Notably, Jepson will discuss 
his first CVE, detailing the coordinated disclosure process and 
subsequent manufacturer response.</p>
<p>This session is semi-technical, ideal for cybersecurity professionals
 and amateurs alike, interested in vehicle network protocols, and 
embedded systems security. Prior knowledge of network protocols such as 
CAN and J1939, along with an understanding of firmware reverse 
engineering, will enhance the learning experience, but is not required. 
Tools and techniques used include network scanners, reverse engineering 
platforms like Ghidra, and various wireless communication methods.</p>
<p>By attending this presentation, participants will not only understand
 the specific security flaws affecting heavy vehicles but also 
appreciate the broader implications for embedded systems security in 
transportation. This talk is a call to action for improving security 
practices and regulatory standards in an increasingly interconnected 
world.</p>

<h3 class="talk-title">Secrets and Shadows: Leveraging Big Data for Vulnerability Discovery at Scale</h3>

  <p class="time-room">Saturday at 16:00 in LVCC - L1 - HW1-11-04 (Track 4)<br>  45 minutes | Demo 💻 </p>

  </h4>

<p class="abstract"></p><p>When we consider the conventional approaches 
to vulnerability discovery, be it in software or websites, we tend to 
confine ourselves to a specific target or platform. In the case of 
software, we might reverse engineer an application's attack surfaces for
 untrusted input, aiming to trigger edge cases. For websites, we might 
enumerate a domain for related assets and seek out unpatched, less 
defended, or occasionally abandoned resources.</p>
<p>This presentation explores the untapped potential of scaling security
 research by leveraging unconventional data sources. We'll walk through 
design flaws that enable two examples: forgotten cloud assets and leaked
 secrets. Instead of starting with a target and finding vulnerabilities,
 we'll find vulnerabilities and relate them to our targets. We won't 
just stop at discovery. We'll also discuss the incentives that create 
them and how to solve the ecosystem issues as an industry.</p>
<p>While you can't easily scale every issue, this project has led to 
tens of thousands of highly significant yet seemingly trivial weaknesses
 in some of the world's largest organizations. Prepare to shift your 
perspective on vulnerability discovery, learn scalable approaches to 
address commonly overlooked bugs, and understand how even the simplest 
misconfiguration can have a devastating impact.</p>

<p class="abstract"></p><p>Between 1850 and 1855, the London-based 
newspaper The Times published over 50 encrypted advertisements 
apparently intended for the same recipient. As we know today, the ads in
 that series were meant for the sea captain Richard Collinson, who at 
the time was on a mission in the Canadian Arctic trying to solve a 
captivating mystery: What happened to the lost John Franklin expedition?
 While Collinson never reached his goal, he established a secure 
worldwide communication system, which was unique for its time.</p>
<p>Before his departure, Collinson's family was taught how to encrypt 
brief reports about what was going on at home and to publish these 
messages as mysterious ads in “The Times” once a month. The cipher used 
was a modified version of a system based on a signal-book of the Royal 
Navy. As the circulation of The Times stretched far beyond the UK, 
Collinson would have the chance to get his hands on a copy even at the 
remotest of ports.</p>
<p>Over a century later, the Collinson ads were finally broken in the 
1990s. Over the last two years, the lecturers of this talk continued 
this work, with a goal of decrypting all of the ads and placing them in 
their appropriate geographic and cultural context.</p>

<p class="abstract"></p><p>With the development of artificial 
intelligence and image processing technology, the video industry such as
 CCTV is developing greatly. However, CCTV video may infringe on an 
individual's privacy, and personal information may be leaked due to 
hacking or illegal video collection. As such, Surveillance System's 
Security issues are also increasing, the importance of the video 
surveillance industry is becoming more prominent.</p>
<p>In order to prevent hacking or illegal video collection, research on 
camera security is being conducted. However, there is a lack of 
awareness of NVR (Network Video Recorder), a device that actually 
watches videos recorded by cameras, and research on this is also 
insufficient.</p>
<p>We selected Hikvision and Dahua, which have a high NVR market share, 
as target vendors, and also selected Synology's NVR-related package, 
Surveillance Station, as targets. Before proceeding with vulnerability 
analysis, several problems occurred during the file system extraction 
process, but U-Boot mitigation was successfully bypassed through various
 methods. Afterwards, various types of vulnerabilities were discovered 
through analysis, and OEM verification was also conducted to increase 
impact. We present exploit scenarios for surveillance devices through 
vulnerability linkage and present supply chain security issues in the 
Surveillance System.</p>

<p class="abstract"></p><p>DEF CON is a siren song for the hacker mind. 
Clever people around the world hear it and are pulled, every year, to 
Las Vegas. They mass by the tens of thousands, streaming through the 
halls of DEF CON to watch talks given by absolute legends about 
incredible escapades, to gaze in wonder as true wizards bend bytes to 
their will in the CTF room, and to dream about one day reaching to those
 heights themselves.</p>
<p>Some have the critical combination of grit, perseverance, raw talent,
 and (let's face it) privilege to push through to those dreams of 
greatness. But among even the clever and the motivated, it is rare for 
n00bs to rise to l33tness without support. Some find this support in 
inspiring classes in college. Others, among friends or mentors. But many
 don't find it at all, and remain in the hallways, dreaming.</p>
<p>Do you want to leave the hallways and hack the planet? We are 
hackers, educators, and learners who are creating DEF CON Academy, a 
concerted effort to maximize hacker potential by providing open, clear, 
approachable, and inclusive practical resources for budding hackers to 
transcend and rule cyberspace. Through extensive DEF CON event presence 
and year-round hacking resources, we will pro up the noobs of the world 
and bring the community, at scale, to the next level of skill.</p>

<p class="abstract"></p><p>VSAT satellite communication systems are 
widely used to provide two-way data and voice communications to remote 
areas, including maritime environments, crisis regions, and other 
locations where terrestrial communication infrastructure is limited or 
unavailable. In this presentation, we report on our security findings 
from our reverse-engineering efforts to exploit VSAT satellite modems 
from the Earth. We will focus on the Newtec MDM2200 from iDirect as an 
example. First, we explain how we reverse-engineered the software stack 
running on the modem device to find 0-day vulnerabilities. Then, we show
 how we reverse-engineered the network stack to devise attacks that can 
be launched by injecting wireless signals through the antenna dish of a 
VSAT terminal. Finally, we demonstrate our software-defined radio 
end-to-end attacks to inject bogus firmware updates and to gain a remote
 root shell access on the modem. To the best of knowledge, this 
represents the first successful demonstration of signal injection 
attacks on VSAT modems using software-defined radios from the Earth, 
while previous attacks on VSAT systems such as the ViaSat hack in 2022 
were based on exploiting the operator’s network through Internet VPN 
connections. Our work therefore enlarges significantly the attack 
surface of VSAT systems.</p>
<p>Our presentation at DEF CON is part of a project that has three parts. </p>
<p>In the first part, we focus on the inherent security issues in 
current VSAT system practices. This work will be appear in May at ACM 
WiSec 2024.</p>

<p class="abstract"></p><p>This talk showcases techniques for process 
injection using advanced return-oriented programming (ROP). Process 
injection via ROP introduces significant hurdles, requiring many WinAPIs
 to be chained together, each with complex parameters and return values.
 We give practical details on how to best manage this. One seemingly 
insurmountable challenge is in identifying the target binary, as string 
comparison can be extremely difficult in ROP, as needed ROP gadgets may 
be lacking. We unveil a unique, universal solution, giving a reliable 
means of string comparison via ROP, which works all the time, allowing a
 specific process to be pinpointed and injected into via ROP.</p>
<p>We created numerous patterns for different WinAPIs, allowing for  as 
many as a dozen ways of preparing a specific WinAPI via ROP, if using an
 approach centered around the PUSHAD instruction. With some WinAPIs, 
there are zero patterns for PUSHAD, forcing us to rely upon the much 
lauded “sniper” approach. We document all such variations of patterns 
for the WinAPIs in our demonstrated process injection. This research is 
not intended to demo a one-off example of process injection via ROP, but
 to provide a methodology that can be used time and time again, 
providing unique templates for others to use the same WinAPIs when 
attempting process injection via ROP.</p>

<p class="abstract"></p><p>For years, eFuse-based memories were used to 
store sensitive information such as encryption keys, passwords, and 
other potentially confidential pieces of information. This practice was 
encouraged by several vendors who leverage such memory types for 
protecting the debugging interfaces using a password or for official way
 to store encryption keys for external flash memories.</p>
<p>However, with the advances in technology and threat actors’ 
creativity, eFuse-based memories may take a hard hit on their 
confidentiality assurance as their physical properties could allow for a
 relatively easy extraction of the stored information. </p>
<p>In this talk we will walk you through the journey of revealing one 
such data storage from decapsulating the chip itself, delayering it 
using common household items all the way to using advanced tools such as
 Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) to read value of an encryption key 
and thus break the confidentiality of the encrypted flash memory.</p>

<p class="abstract"></p><p>Websites often parse users' email addresses 
to identify their organisation. Unfortunately, parsing emails is far 
from straightforward thanks to a collection of ancient RFCs that 
everyone knows are crazy. You can probably see where this is going…</p>
<p>In this session, I'll introduce techniques for crafting RFC-compliant
 email addresses that bypass virtually all defences leading to broken 
assumptions, parser discrepancies and emails being routed to wildly 
unexpected destinations. I'll show you how to exploit multiple 
applications and libraries to spoof email domains, access internal 
systems protected by 'Zero Trust', and bypass employee-only registration
 barriers.</p>
<p>Then I'll introduce another class of attack - harmless-looking input 
transformed into malicious payloads by unwitting libraries, leading to 
yet more misrouted emails, and blind CSS injection on a well-known 
target.</p>
<p>I'll leave you with a full methodology and toolkit to identify and 
exploit your own targets, plus a CTF to develop your new skillset.</p>

 resources from AWS, digging in 3.1 million AMIs for secrets. Beyond the
 findings, we'll delve into the ominous connection between exfiltrated 
AWS access credentials from these AMIs and the heightened risk of AWS 
account takeover. This talk will highlight key methodologies, tools, and
 lessons learned, emphasizing the critical need for robust security 
measures in the cloud to prevent both data exposure and potential 
account compromise.</p>

  <p class="time-room">Sunday at 10:00 in LVCC - L1 - HW1-11-03 (Track 3)<br>  45 minutes | Demo 💻, Exploit 🪲, Tool 🛠 </p>

  <h4 class="speaker">Alon Leviev </h4>

<p class="abstract"></p><p>Downgrade attacks force software to revert to
 an older, vulnerable version. In 2023, BlackLotus emerged, downgrading 
the boot manager to bypass Secure Boot. Microsoft addressed the threat, 
but was Secure Boot the only component vulnerable to downgrades?</p>
<p>By examining Windows Updates, we found a flaw enabling us to take 
full control over it and craft downgrading updates, bypassing all 
verification steps.</p>
<p>We then managed to downgrade DLLs, drivers, and even the kernel. 
Afterwards, the OS reported it’s fully updated, unable to install future
 updates, with recovery tools unable to detect issues.</p>
<p>We aimed higher and found that the virtualization stack is at risk 
too. We successfully downgraded Hyper-V’s hypervisor, Secure Kernel, and
 Credential Guard to expose privilege escalations.</p>
<p>We also discovered several ways to disable VBS, including its 
Credential Guard and HVCI features, despite its enforced UEFI locks. 
This is the first known bypass of VBS's UEFI locks.</p>
<p>Lastly, we found another vulnerability in a Windows Update 
restoration scenario, making the findings accessible to unprivileged 
attackers!</p>
<p>In this talk, we’ll introduce "Windows Downdate", a tool that takes 
over Windows Updates to craft downgrades and expose dozens of 
vulnerabilities. It makes the term “fully patched” meaningless across 
any Windows machine worldwide.</p><p></p>

<p class="abstract"></p><p>People who don’t type Chinese might be 
surprised to learn that popular Chinese Input Method Editor (IME) 
keyboards can act as keyloggers; they transmit your keystrokes over the 
Internet to enable “cloud-based” support features to improve character 
prediction when typing.</p>
<p><em>Everyone</em> might be surprised to learn that these keyloggers, 
which were already collecting everything you type into your device, were
 doing it <em>insecurely</em>.</p>
<p>In this talk, we will describe how we systematically exploited every 
single popular Chinese IME keyboard vendor’s home-rolled network 
encryption protocol. Namely, we show how any network eavesdropper can 
read the keystrokes of what users of these vendors’ keyboards are 
typing. The affected keyboards include the three most popular Chinese 
IME keyboards, Sogou IME, Baidu IME, and iFlytek IME, collectively used 
by almost 800 million users, as well as default and pre-installed 
keyboards on basically every popular Android mobile device except for 
Huawei’s. We also discuss how we got here, re-affirm the age-old adage, 
“Don’t roll your own crypto!”, and call on hackers around the world to 
help us move towards HTTPS everywhere in understudied app ecosystems.</p>

<p class="abstract"></p><p>LDAP is no stranger to the security 
spotlight. While LDAP is a protocol (Lightweight Directory Access 
Protocol) and Active Directory is the most popular directory services 
system that supports a subset of LDAP, the terms “LDAP” and “AD” are 
tightly coupled when discussing the execution, detection and prevention 
of attacks targeting directory services data.</p>
<p>In the last decade the widespread offensive value of querying AD data
 via LDAP was cemented with the release of open-source tools such as 
BloodHound and PingCastle. However, proper visibility of LDAP queries 
mostly remains a privileged asset for those organizations with deep 
pockets, and the commercial security tools providing this visibility are
 often woefully fixated on simple signature-based detections.</p>
<p>MaLDAPtive is the 2,000-hour (and counting) quest of offensive and 
defensive LDAP exploration and tool-building. This research includes 
mind-bending depths of obfuscation across all elements of LDAP queries 
(many undocumented and most never seen in the wild), all baked into an 
obfuscation/de-obfuscation/detection framework built upon our ground-up 
custom LDAP search filter tokenizer and syntax tree parser.</p>

framework: transforming LDAP from “lightweight” to “heavyweight.”</p>

The automotive underworld of huge corporations, short deadlines and 
lukewarm engineers. The one where companies fight for packing more and 
more functionality inside your computer on wheels, without paying 
attention to one of the things that our life actually depends on right 
now, cybersecurity.</p>
<p>While others talk about extremely significant remote vulnerabilities,
 I will focus on a high-level view of architecture and design of 
vehicles and where security fits in these processes. I will go through a
 journey of exploitation, from discovering 0days, to persuading 
engineers for the significance of a finding, by putting him in the 
driving seat and engaging the breaks mid-journey.</p>
<p>I will conclude, trying to understand why this is happening, why this
 behavior towards security still exists in the automotive industry, and 
how a small manufacturer managed to create one of the most secure 
embedded systems I faced in my career. All this, with a series of demos 
in real targets, and a real ECU on stage.</p>
<p>Our ultimate goal is to help people understand the state of the 
industry, spark the interest which can come out of hacking a computer on
 wheels, and try to raise awareness with a bit of hack, a bit of crash 
and two smoking barrels.</p>

<p class="abstract"></p><p>In this presentation, we will unveil a new 
attack surface: Device Virtualization in VMKernel. This isan unknown 
territory that has not been explored by security researchers to date. 
During the reverse engineering of the VMware Hypervisor, we discovered 8
 vulnerabilities related to device virtualization, 3 of them have been 
assigned CVE number (some vulnerabilities have even been successfully 
exploited in Tianfu Cup), and the remaining 5 of our vulnerabilities 
have been officially confirmed by VMware.</p>
<p>Firstly we will delve into the loading process of vmm, the 
implementation of data sharing between vmm and vmx, and VMware's 
UserRPC, which facilitates communication between the Hypervisor and the 
Host. These mechanisms are crucial in virtual device emulation.</p>
<p>Then We will explain security issues in various parts of the USB 
system, including the host controller, VUsb middleware, and VUsb backend
 devices, based on the vulnerabilities we have unearthed.</p>
<p>In the end, We will primarily discuss the similarities and 
differences in SCSI-related device emulation in the virtual disk system 
between VMware Workstation and ESXi Additionally, we will cover design 
flaws related to disk device emulation that we discovered in VMKernel.</p>

<h3 class="talk-title">Deception &amp; Counter Deception – Defending Yourself in a World Full of Lies</h3>

<p class="abstract"></p><p>The Internet was supposed to give us access 
to the world's information, so that people, everywhere, would be able to
 know the truth. But that’s not how things worked out. Instead, we have a
 digital deception engine of global proportions. Nothing that comes 
through the screen can be trusted, and even the things that are 
technically true have been selected, massaged, and amplified in support 
of someone’s messaging strategy.</p>
<p>Deception isn’t just about narratives - we see deception at every 
layer of the network stack, from spoofed electromagnetic signatures, to 
false flags in malware, to phony personas used to access networks and 
spread influence. They hide in our blindspots, exploit our biases, and 
fill our egos while manipulating our perceptions.</p>
<p>How do we decide what is real? This talk examines time-tested maxims 
that teach the craft of effective deception, and then inverts those 
offensive principles to provide defensive strategies. We’ll explore ways
 to counter biases, triangulate information sources, detect narratives, 
and how hackers can build tools that can change the game.</p>
<p>At their best, hackers lift their heads up above the masses to see 
how the world actually works, not how it purports to work, and then take
 action to make the world a better place. You’ll leave this talk with 
practical skills to do just that.</p><p></p>

<h3 class="talk-title">Modem Operandi, or: How I Owned Hundreds of Millions of Broadband Basebands</h3>

  <p class="time-room">Sunday at 11:30 in LVCC - L1 - HW1-11-04 (Track 4)<br>  45 minutes | Demo 💻, Exploit 🪲, Tool 🛠 </p>

  </h4>

<p class="abstract"></p><p>The world runs on broadband, be it fiber, 
cable, or faster variants of DSL. The 5G revolution may be here, but 
cellular modems just connect users to the internet. 8 in 10 US adults 
subscribe to a broadband internet service at home, connected via modern 
fiber, cable, and DSL modems, not to mention 4K set-top boxes. These 
devices often run Linux, but what you might not realize is that recent 
devices secretly have a second CPU running a proprietary RTOS, akin to 
the baseband of mobile devices. And like mobile basebands, the security 
of the embedded OS can undermine the security of the device as a whole.</p>
<p>In this talk, we will discuss the proprietarty embedded RTOS used by 
modern broadband devices. We'll start with an overview of how the RTOS 
works, when and why it was introduced, and discuss its true lineage and 
identity. We will then dive into the low-level internals of the RTOS and
 how it shares resources with the "frontend" Linux OS. Lastly, we will 
discuss the "private bridge" IPC mechanism that the RTOS uses to 
communicate with the frontend OS, and the threat model that should have 
been applied to such multi-OS devices. Along the way, we'll discuss 
several vulnerabilities we discovered in the layers of the RTOS and the 
private bridge, and how they can be abused to remotely take over both 
the RTOS and Linux.</p>

  </h4>

<p class="abstract"></p><p>This article reassesses the complex 
cyberattack tactics utilized by the Stuxnet worm, focusing specifically 
on existing security measures and emerging weaknesses. We begin our 
investigation by examining Stuxnet's initial methods of deployment, 
which allows us to investigate contemporary attacks, including those 
that focus on simulated read-only filesystems and NTFS vulnerabilities. 
Since the improvements made to the Windows security architecture in 
2011, which include Device Guard Signature Enforcement (DSE) and 
Hypervisor-protected Code Integrity (HVCI), the nature of cyber threats 
has changed, requiring the need for new ways to carry out attacks.</p>
<p>Our research presents a new method that takes advantage of previously
 uncovered weaknesses in emulated filesystems, allowing attackers to 
covertly install and maintain harmful programs in a way similar to the 
activities of Stuxnet. In addition, we uncover new NTFS vulnerabilities 
that enable attackers to conceal their presence and sustain persistence 
within victim systems. The study also introduces innovative techniques 
to identify susceptible drivers and investigates alternate methods for 
delivering and executing malware, similar to the strategies employed by 
Stuxnet. In addition, we create novel Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) to
 identify and detect these advanced tactics.</p>
<p>The main techniques presented in this talk are based on a joint 
research with Jonas Lyk. A few references were used to explain the more 
general concept of BYOVD (Bring your own vulnerable driver). Other 
references can be found in the draft Whitepaper.</p>

<p class="abstract"></p><p>Modern cars are a complex networks of 
computers put on four wheels. For security research, it is important to 
understand the car's internal network and exposed interfaces. But what 
else could you use this knowledge for? You probably guessed it from the 
title 🙂. So we developed a tool to turn our research car into a game 
controller.</p>
<p>In this talk, we present Vehicle-to-Game (V2G), a Python-based 
project that enables the usage of cars as game controllers. V2G can run 
either directly on a laptop or turn a Raspberry Pi Zero WH into a 
Bluetooth gamepad. In addition, V2G can either be used over the 
OBD2-diagnostic port or by directly accessing the internal CAN-busses of
 the car.</p>
<p>Our project can be a great starting point if you always wanted to 
tinker around with your car or want to learn about the CAN bus or 
diagnostic communication (UDS). To make V2G work with your car, some 
reverse engineering of CAN messages or diagnostic communication will be 
required (as well as additional hardware to connect to the CAN bus). 
Otherwise, if you can get this running, you can be sure that you own a 
more expensive game controller than your neighbors.</p>

<p class="abstract"></p><p>As the successor to the iptables, nftables 
stands as a crucial network component within the Linux kernel, managing 
packet filtering and other network-related functionalities. With 
continuous development and changes, features designed to increase its 
efficiency, such as batch commit, anonymous chains/sets, and 
asynchronous garbage collection, have been implemented, which in turn 
has significantly increased its complexity and made it an attractive 
target for attackers in recent years.</p>
<p>Since the announcement of the kernelCTF bug bounty, multiple nftables
 0-day vulnerabilities have been reported and patched to enhance its 
security. However, if not careful enough, the security patch may not 
only mitigate the bug but also introduce new security issues 
unintentionally. By researching the structural changes in the nftables 
codebase, we successfully uncover new vulnerabilities despite the 
intense competition in kernelCTF. Also, we managed to speedrun the 
exploitation just before Google removed nftables from LTS instance, 
becoming the last LTS nftables exploitation.</p>
<p>In this presentation, we want to share three vulnerability that we 
discovered in nftables. We will first provide an in-depth overview of 
nftables internals and explore the previously exploited issues to 
familiarize attendees with the attack vectors in nftable. Next, we will 
dissecting three vulnerability discovered during our journey, which two 
of them involved utilizing hard-to-exploit race condition to pwn the 
flag. Alongside details of the exploitation, we will also share the 
roller-coaster story of kernelCTF experiences, it filled with dramatic 
highs and lows, making it a tense and exhilarating journey.</p>

<p class="abstract"></p><p>AI assistants like ChatGPT are changing how 
we interact with technology. But what if someone could read your 
confidential chats? Imagine awkwardly asking your AI about a strange 
rash, or to edit an email, only to have that conversation exposed to 
someone on the net. In this talk we'll unveil a novel side-channel 
vulnerability in popular AI assistants and demonstrate how it can be 
used to read encrypted messages sent from AI Assistants.</p>
<p>Before our disclosure, major players like OpenAI, Microsoft, 
Cloudflare, Quora, and Notion were at risk. We'll reveal the technical 
details of this exploit and show real-world examples of intercepted 
conversations. This talk isn't just about the problem – learn how to 
identify this vulnerability in other AI assistants as well! We'll 
dissect network traffic, discuss attack models, and explore the 
far-reaching consequences of this discovery.</p>

  </h4>

<p class="abstract"></p><p>Machine learning (ML) pipelines are 
vulnerable to model backdoors that compromise the integrity of the 
underlying system. Although many backdoor attacks limit the attack 
surface to the model, ML models are not standalone objects. Instead, 
they are artifacts built using a wide range of tools and embedded into 
pipelines with many interacting components. </p>
<p>In this talk, we introduce incubated ML exploits in which attackers 
inject model backdoors into ML pipelines using input-handling bugs in ML
 tools. Using a language-theoretic security (LangSec) framework, we 
systematically exploited ML model serialization bugs in popular tools to
 construct backdoors. In the process, we developed malicious artifacts 
such as polyglot and ambiguous files using ML model files. We also 
contributed to Fickling, a pickle security tool tailored for ML use 
cases. Finally, we formulated a set of guidelines for security 
researchers and ML practitioners. By chaining system security issues and
 model vulnerabilities, incubated ML exploits emerge as a new class of 
exploits that highlight the importance of a holistic approach to ML 
security.</p>

<p class="abstract"></p><p>In this study, we delve into the darker 
aspects of railway technology, revealing how easily accessible domestic 
hardware tools can compromise the seemingly infallible robustness of 
signaling systems. We demonstrate how these accessible technologies can 
be utilized to devise strategies that potentially threaten train 
circulation in Spain. Our research presents a critical analysis of the 
vulnerabilities present in the railway signaling systems, highlighting 
the ease with which these systems can be tampered with, using tools that
 are readily available to the general public. Through a combination of 
theoretical insights and practical demonstrations, we offer a 
comprehensive overview of the risks associated with such 
vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>Our findings aim to raise awareness among stakeholders in the railway
 industry, prompting a reevaluation of current security measures and 
encouraging the adoption of more stringent protections against such 
threats. This paper contributes to the ongoing discussion in the 
cybersecurity community, offering valuable insights into the potential 
risks facing modern transportation infrastructures and suggesting 
avenues for future research and development in railway system security.</p>
<p>We consider this work to be innovative on a type of system that has 
been present for over half a century in railway infrastructures. 
Therefore, the references provided are primarily about the operation of 
the systems and relevant news concerning them.</p>
