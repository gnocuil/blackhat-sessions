<h3 class="talk-title">Differential privacy beyond algorithms: Challenges for successful deployment</h3>

  <p class="time-room">Friday at 10:00 in LVCC - L1 - HW2-07-04 (Creator Stage 1)<br>  60 minutes </p>

<p class="abstract"></p><p>Differential privacy (DP) has been hailed as 
the gold standard of privacy-preserving data analysis, by providing 
strong privacy guarantees while still enabling use of potentially 
sensitive data. Formally, DP gives a mathematically rigorous worst-case 
bound on the maximum amount of information that can be learned about an 
individual's data from the output of a computation. In the past two 
decades, the privacy community has developed DP algorithms that satisfy 
this privacy guarantee and allow for accurate data analysis for a wide 
variety of computational problems and application domains. We have also 
begun to see a number of high-profile deployments of DP systems in 
practice, both at large technology companies and government entities. 
Despite the promise and success of DP thus far, there are a number of 
critical challenges left to be addressed before DP can be easily 
deployed in practice, including: mapping the mathematical privacy 
guarantees onto protection against real-world threats, developing 
explanations of its guarantees and tradeoffs for non-technical users, 
integration with other privacy &amp; security tools, preventing misuse, 
and more.</p><p></p>

<h3 class="talk-title">Does the World Need Another Threat Model, the Road to EMB3D</h3>

  <p class="time-room">Friday at 10:00 in LVCC - L1 - HW3-06-02 (Creator Stage 2)<br>  30 minutes | Tool üõ† </p>

  <h4 class="speaker">Niyo Little Thunder Pearson </h4>
<h4 class="speaker"><span class="speaker-affiliation">on behalf of ICS Village</span></h4>

<p class="abstract"></p><p>With all the various threat model frameworks available, STRIDE, Trike, PASTA, VAST, etc., does the world need another one?</p>
<p>That was the question that shaped the creation of EMB3D, a threat 
model framework built around embedded systems (specifically in critical 
infrastructure) that addresses all phases of a threat to them: from the 
theorical/academic, proof of concept and exploit, to observed 
adversarial behavior.</p>
<p>But the goal was greater than just the threat framework, it was to 
bring a common language to the global community to discuss weaknesses 
and threats while striving to bring transparency to what are considered 
‚Äúblack box‚Äù electronic systems.</p>
<p>In this presentation, we take you on the journey of how we went from 
venting about needing more transparency and accountability in the OT/ICS
 space to developing a new global threat model for embedded systems.</p><p></p>

<p class="abstract"></p><p>This talk covers how to approach vulnerability research against Meta Quest headsets and VR applications.</p>
<p>We explore how to approach discovering bugs in the Meta Quest through
 the third-party app attack surface. This emulates what potentially 
malicious apps could achieve once installed and the unique attacks 
available in comparison to general mobile malware. This research 
culminates in a demonstration of triggering a novel vulnerability 
discovered in the OpenXR client implementation of the Quest.</p>
<p>Beyond this, we cover the unique remote attack surface exposed via 
the Horizons and first-party social app of the Quest - in particular we 
focus on attacking the rendering of user avatars. These bugs are 
possible to be triggered whenever within the same virtual space as a 
malicious user and represent a new attack surface not previously 
available. This research culminates in triggering a novel vulnerability 
in libovravatar2p.so which allows remote memory corruption and 
represents the building blocks for RCE across the metaverse.</p><p></p>

<h3 class="talk-title">Practical Exploitation of DoS in Bug Bounty</h3>

  <p class="time-room">Friday at 10:00 in LVCC - L2 - W222 (Creator Stage 4)<br>  60 minutes </p>

  <h4 class="speaker">Roni "Lupin" Carta  
  <span class="speaker-title">Co-Founder at Lupin &amp; Holmes</span>
  
  
  </h4>
<h4 class="speaker"><span class="speaker-affiliation">on behalf of Bug Bounty Village</span></h4>

<p class="abstract"></p><p>The talk "Practical Exploitation of DoS in 
Bug Bounty" explains methods for identifying and exploiting Denial of 
Service (DoS) vulnerabilities in bug bounty programs. Starting with an 
overview of DoS attacks and their impact, we will highlight how these 
attacks disrupt services by overwhelming resources or exploiting flaws. 
The talk covers various DoS attack types, including N+1 errors, in-depth
 GraphQL crashing, and Cache Poisoning, with real-world examples 
demonstrating their effects.</p>
<p>We will then detail practical techniques for discovering DoS 
vulnerabilities. This includes automated scanning tools, manual testing 
methods, and understanding the target system's architecture.</p>
<p>N+1 errors occur when an application makes redundant database 
queries, significantly impacting performance. Attackers can exploit this
 by triggering numerous unnecessary queries, causing severe slowdowns or
 crashes. GraphQL, a query language for APIs, can be vulnerable to 
complex queries that consume excessive resources, leading to server 
crashes. We will show how to craft such queries and the resulting 
impact. Cache Poisoning involves manipulating cached data to serve 
malicious or incorrect content, which can disrupt services or degrade 
performance. We will explore techniques to poison caches and demonstrate
 the potential consequences.</p>
<p>Additionally, the talk emphasizes the importance of responsibly 
reporting discovered vulnerabilities to bug bounty programs. Best 
practices are shared for effectively communicating findings and ensuring
 timely mitigation. Of course, there are some fails during this path, 
and those are going to be covered too.</p>
<p>The session wraps up by stressing the need for continuous learning 
and staying updated on the latest trends in DoS attack vectors and 
mitigation strategies</p><p></p>

<h3 class="talk-title">Attack and Defence in OT - Simulating attacks against hydroelectric power plants leveraging ICS Firing Ranges</h3>

  <p class="time-room">Friday at 10:30 in LVCC - L1 - HW3-06-02 (Creator Stage 2)<br>  30 minutes | Demo üíª </p>

  <h4 class="speaker">Julia Dewitz-W√ºrzelberger  
  <span class="speaker-title">Project Manager, OT Cyber Security at VERBUND</span>
  
  
  </h4>
<h4 class="speaker"><span class="speaker-affiliation">on behalf of ICS Village</span></h4>

<p class="abstract"></p><p>In this talk we will present the ICS firing 
range we built and hacked to simulate an actual attack against a 
hydroelectric power plant and create a DFIR training from the evidence 
left behind. The talk aims to emphasize the importance of attack 
simulation in the context of critical infrastructure and the potential 
benefit that firing ranges can provide to such assessments.</p>
<p>First we will examine the motivation behind the construction and usage of a firing range, covering various aspects including:</p>
<ul>
<li>the threats operators of critical infrastructure face,</li>
<li>how security assessments are conducted in an OT context and</li>
<li>how an ICS firing range can be utilized to support them.</li>
</ul>
<p>Next we will discuss the intended use cases of the firing range and 
the scenario it was made to display, the flooding of a hydroelectric 
power plant. As a result, the relevant components and production 
processes of the plant will be outlined.
Then we will present and go into detail about the design &amp; 
architecture of the firing range:</p>
<ul>
<li>individual physical and virtual networks and components,</li>
<li>separate Active Directory environments,</li>
<li>implemented security measures</li>
<li>specific vulnerabilities intentionally left behind. </li>
</ul>
<p>Picking up this last bullet-point, we continue with how we hacked the
 firing range and performed a Red Team assessment against it, simulating
 an actual attack. Starting with the C2 infrastructure we set up for the
 attack, we will guide the audience through the kill chain in 
chronological order and highlight the most important and relevant steps 
of the attack.</p>
<p>Once the offensive part of the talk concludes, a shift of perspective
 takes place and the attack is evaluated from the defence's 
point-of-view: we'll show how we identified, secured and analyzed 
indicators of compromise left behind by the attack. This includes the 
analysis of network captures, Windows event logs, memory dumps and more.</p>
<p>This talk will be presented by not only people from NVISO as the IT 
security service provider who built the firing range and performed to 
attack against it, but also by people from VERBUND's IT security team 
who actively use the firing range for training. This way we can involve 
both the attacker's and the defence's point-of-view.</p><p></p>

<h3 class="talk-title">Travel Better: Expedient Digital Defense</h3>

  <p class="time-room">Friday at 11:00 in LVCC - L1 - HW2-07-04 (Creator Stage 1)<br>  30 minutes </p>

  <h4 class="speaker">Grey Fox </h4>
<h4 class="speaker"><span class="speaker-affiliation">on behalf of Crypto Privacy Village</span></h4>

<p class="abstract"></p><p>Expedient Digital Defense focuses on using 
free and readily available applications, or recommending paid-for 
commercial apps and tools that have proven records of credibility, to 
make our devices and online presence less harmful to us. We will follow a
 typical traveler in the United States, with some experiences drawn from
 overseas travel.</p>
<p>The talk stresses the value of Operational Security (OPSEC), and the 
mindset of seeing every piece of communication through the eyes of your 
adversary. The intent is to make people think twice before revealing 
anything considered sensitive, even if using the latest and greatest 
encryption. The surveillance economy and ever-present data collection in
 our modern world demand better awareness of how our digital world 
works. We‚Äôll discuss examples like invasive social media collection, 
foreign influence on public perception, data insecurity putting users in
 danger, and advertising models based on location and click tracking.</p>
<p>Finally, the take-away is knowing the tools and tech available, and 
being able to select those which fit your needs, if at all. Most of the 
time, one mitigation isn't enough, and several need to be emplaced to 
achieve proper defense in depth, in case one solution fails. Even if no 
technical solutions are put in place, the user will have that "red team"
 mindset and awareness that calibrates better judgment over technical 
solutions, and promotes OPSEC and rational thinking for security rather 
than blindly depending on apps and gadgets.</p><p></p>

<p class="abstract"></p><p>The DOE National Lab mission space includes 
exploring the use of disruptive technology to enable increasing 
efficiency and abilities of operations critical to national security, 
infrastructure, communication, and many other fields. The XR field has 
become a new area of active research and implementation at many national
 labs across the US, integrating with cutting edge hardware and software
 to enable users with increased capabilities. At the Pacific Northwest 
National Lab (PNNL), we have been using immersive XR platforms to enable
 a variety of government and external sponsors with novel approaches to 
their field. These include creating new 3D virtual twins to enable 
remote engagements as if remote users had access to one-of-a-kind lab 
equipment, creating simulation environments of hazardous environments or
 dangerous situations that can‚Äôt be recreated in the real world, and 
outreach and communication projects to engage both sponsors and the 
public with critical information about current security threats. During 
this presentation I will touch on a few case studies of projects taken 
on at PNNL to make the best use of XR platforms, and where we see future
 development with this capability.</p><p></p>

<p class="abstract"></p><p>Step into the mind of a bug bounty hunter as I
 take you on a journey through my own adventures in vulnerability 
hunting. In this presentation, I‚Äôll share some of the most intriguing 
bugs I've discovered, from the shockingly/stupidly simple to the 
mind-bendingly complex.</p>
<p>We'll start with the surprising simplicity of some bugs, but as the 
hunt isn‚Äôt always so simple, I‚Äôll also reveal some complex bug chains 
that required advanced knowledge, lot of work and probably some hacker's
 intuition to know it was worth pushing further.</p>
<p>If you want to know how a coffee break gave me the opportunity to get
 infinite money, or how a vulnerable CAPTCHA helped me to break the 
encryption of a sensitive application - you're in the right place!</p><p></p>

everything, but they're A LOT of time, money, and effort including but 
not limited to hardware, software and art design, testing, 
manufacturing, testing, provisioning, and repairing.</p>
<p>I'll share OpenTaxus, a relatively simple, cheap, mass-producible, 
and open-source badge design. We'll start out by looking at and 
understanding the design and implementation, highlighting the areas 
worth customizing (and which to leave as-s). I'll do a walkthrough of a 
few changes to customize the design - in KiCAD for hardware changes, and
 in CircuitPython for software changes.</p>
<p>We'll wrap up with some discussion of how to handle cost reduction to
 fit in a certain budget, manage badge logistics for events of different
 sizes, and warn about some of the many pitfalls that electronic badges 
suffer. You should walk away with the ability to customize a badge to be
 mass produced for your own event.</p><p></p>

attacks to attacks propagated by state sponsored threat actors; 
targeting elections, organizations,  critical infrastructure etc. 
Organizations have had to step up and compensate with additional 
security controls and  resources. We are living in a phase where even 
the most secure organizations are not immune to targeted cyber  threats,
 the landscape of cyber security is in the state of constant evolution, 
with everybody playing to catch up.  </p>
<p>This panel has been structured to delve into the complex and evolving
 nature of cyber adversaries. Beginning with  an overview of recent 
cyber-attacks, breaches, and targeted ransomware incidents. We will also
 examine the rising  wave of state sponsored threat actors, while 
focusing on their sophisticated adversary tactics, techniques and  
procedures. </p>
<p>This panel will focus on why organizations with even the most 
advanced cyber defense tooling and more than  capable resources are 
still affected by breaches and threat actors. Our panel of experts will 
discuss the reasons  behind these incidents and provide Insights into 
effective response and contentment strategies. Conversation will  
explore the critical components of how efficiently respond to threats, 
contain, and remediate them. </p>
<p>Additionally, the panel will also touch upon how threat intel 
assisted adversarial attack simulation, offensive cyber  security 
operations could be used as proactive measures in enhancing an 
organization‚Äôs defense posture, offering  valuable insights into the 
mindset and methodologies of potential attackers. </p><p></p>

named PacketGlass to visualize and explore the terabytes of information 
collected over multiple surveys. Our system collects all data types 
supported by Kismet plus raw PCAP data, ingests the data, and displays 
tens of millions of devices in an easy to query and display manner. 
Using different parsing techniques, We plan to show how to build one of 
these survey platforms and discuss the methodology used to transform 
Elastic into a robust analytical platform.</p><p></p>

<h4 class="speaker"><span class="speaker-affiliation">on behalf of ICS Village</span></h4>

<p class="abstract"></p><p>Economic efficiency and increasing automation
 mean that many industrial assets are remotely monitored and controlled.
 While some assets, such as oil production platforms, remain manned in 
isolated conditions, the ecosystem of renewable energy and distributed 
energy resources (DERs), pipelines, and other assets are increasingly 
unmanned with control extending over common information links. While 
this has been a boon for cost, it has also resulted in a radical 
extension of attack surface for cyber operations.</p>
<p>In this discussion, we will explore the nature of distributed 
industrial asset operation and the opportunities this presents for 
adversaries to infiltrate and potentially disrupt critical 
infrastructure operations. To make this point, we will review examples 
of adversary activity, from the 2022 ViaSat incident through historical 
pipeline intrusions (NOT Colonial!), showing how adversaries 
intentionally or inadvertently prey on brittle communication links for 
industrial disruption. We will conclude with a discussion of how these 
risks can be mitigated in a way that is sensible and economical, because
 wind farm operators won't lay their own dedicated fiber anytime soon.</p><p></p>

<p class="abstract"></p><p>Social media have been a decade-long dress 
rehearsal in online manipulation. AI can create information, make 
predictions and take decisions that will affect human behaviour, 
including our behaviours as citizens, workers and consumers. Safeguards 
are needed, since generative AI will only exacerbate the personal, 
social and societal harms already caused by data-driven business models.</p>
<p>We examine the centrality of human dignity in tech law and policy and
 how our mindsets and legal frameworks must be informed by 
psychological, technological and societal perspectives. Based on 
insights from market dynamics, marketing techniques, design strategies, 
and human frailties we demonstrate how information asymmetries have 
reduced individual agency and the ability to create transparency.</p>
<p>Human dignity is a core value in liberal democracies that must also 
be reflected in tech policy. Protections are required when businesses 
interfere with our rights to freedom, property, privacy and 
non-discrimination. With the digitalisation of the human experience, 
users have become programmable objects. We cannot rely on regulation 
alone and need to discuss how we can act to reclaim our dignity.</p><p></p>

<p class="abstract"></p><p>In recent years, the use of dash cams has 
surged, making them an essential component of modern vehicles. To 
enhance user convenience, many dash cams are now equipped with network 
connectivity. This growth in the dash cam market has heightened the 
importance of vehicle and personal data security. However, 
network-connected dash cams pose potential security risks to their 
availability and key functionalities.  In this presentation, we will 
comprehensively analyze dash cams from various countries, including 
South Korea, the USA, Germany, and China, as well as built-in dash cams.
 During our analysis, we discovered numerous zero-day vulnerabilities 
(such as OS Command Injection, Logical Bugs, and insufficient 
authentication) that pose significant security threats. Vulnerabilities 
were primarily found during the dash cam boot process, configuration 
changes, and communications via custom protocols. We will detail the 
dash cam analysis process in the following sequence:</p>
<p>[Analysis Process]</p>
<ul>
<li>Acquiring firmware through official websites or apps</li>
<li>Extracting the file system to analyze the initial boot logic</li>
<li>Analyzing the boot logic to identify vulnerabilities or debugging ports to gain shell access</li>
<li>Utilizing the obtained shell for remote debugging of the main system</li>
</ul>
<p>Interestingly, our analysis of 10 different dash cams revealed that 4
 devices used the same OEM board from a common manufacturer. These 4 
devices shared similar vulnerabilities, and exploiting a vulnerability 
found in one device allowed us to successfully exploit all of them.  Our
 research uncovered common security vulnerabilities across multiple dash
 cams, and we will discuss measures to prevent these vulnerabilities. We
 will particularly focus on analyzing the custom protocols used by dash 
cams and the security risks associated with them.  This presentation 
aims to raise awareness of potential security threats in dash cams and 
encourage manufacturers to produce more secure products. We hope to 
drive industry standards and best practices to ensure the safety and 
security of these increasingly critical devices.  By sharing our 
findings, we aim to highlight the importance of dash cam security and 
provide insights that can lead to more secure designs and 
implementations.</p><p></p>

<p class="abstract"></p><p>Space missions have increasingly been the 
subject in the context of security breaches and satellite hacks. The 
majority of discussions revolve around direct communication and access 
to spacecraft through means such as Software Defined Radio. However, the
 reality is that this approach isn't practical for most adversaries, as 
it requires substantial resources and is easily detectable due to the 
power and radio frequencies required to command a spacecraft. Instead, 
adversaries might shift their focus away from the Space Segment and opt 
for a more practical approach, such as accessing and exploiting the 
Ground Segment vulnerabilities and flaws in order to gain control over 
spacecraft. Every space mission comprises custom-made hardware and 
software components, which interact with each other utilizing dedicated 
protocols and standards designed and developed for this sole purpose. 
Numerous potential failure points can adversely impact a space mission, 
many of which persist on the ground. Considering the essential services 
they facilitate and the extent to which contemporary society relies on 
space technology, each component utilized in space missions should be 
regarded as integral to critical infrastructure and treated as such, 
particularly from a security standpoint. This study centers on the Space
 Link Extension (SLE) protocol, which is employed as a standard for 
communication between mission data systems and ground stations by 
various space agencies and organizations, including NASA and ESA. We 
will address the security concerns inherent in the SLE protocol. At the 
same time, we demonstrate methods and techniques malicious actors can 
employ to conduct a Denial of Service (DoS) or tap into the ground 
station communications, gaining control over an actual spacecraft. We 
will conclude this publication by presenting the reader with a possible 
mitigation strategy that we believe should be employed at the SLE 
protocol level. Additionally, we will outline a forecast for future 
work, detailing both planned endeavors and those already in progress, to
 further expand on this research.</p><p></p>

<p class="abstract"></p><p>Holding upwards of $400,000, ATMs continue to
 be a target of opportunity and have seen over a 600% increase in crime 
in just the last few years. During this time, I led security research 
with another colleague into the enterprise ATM industry resulting in the
 discovery of 6 zero-day vulnerabilities affecting Diebold Nixdorf‚Äôs 
Vynamic Security Suite (VSS), the most prolific ATM security solution in
 the market. 10 minutes or less is all that a malicious actor would need
 to gain full control of any system running VSS via offline code 
injection and decryption of the primary Windows OS. Diebold Nixdorf is 
one of three major North American enterprise class ATM manufacturers 
with a global presence in the financial, casino/gaming, and 
point-of-sale markets. Similar attack surfaces are currently being used 
in the wild and impact millions of systems across the globe. 
Furthermore, VSS is known to be present throughout the US gaming 
industry, including most of the ATM/cash-out systems across Vegas.</p>
<p>In this session, I will walk through my research, review the 
discovery process, and dive into the technical intricacies of each 
vulnerability. The Full Disk Encryption module of VSS conducts a complex
 integrity validation process to ensure a trusted system state, 
performed as a layered approach during system initialization. 
Examination of this workflow will highlight various deficiencies that I 
will demonstrate through PoC exploitation.</p>
<p>Each vulnerability presented in this session has been observed to 
have a recursive impact across all major versions of VSS and represents a
 systemic ongoing risk. We will explore the root-cause, vendor 
remediation steps, and short-comings thereof ‚Äì perpetuating the attack 
narrative. In conclusion, proper mitigation techniques and procedures 
will be covered, providing valuable insights into defending against 
potential compromise.</p><p></p>

<p class="abstract"></p><p>Automatic Dependent Surveillance ‚Äì Contract 
(ADS-C) is a satellite-based aviation datalink application used to 
monitor aircraft in remote regions. It is a crucial method for air 
traffic control to track aircraft where other protocols such as ADS-B 
lack connectivity. Even though it has been conceived more than 30 years 
ago, and other legacy communication protocols in aviation have shown to 
be vulnerable, ADS-C‚Äôs security has not been investigated so far in the 
literature. We conduct a first investigation to close this gap. First, 
we compile a comprehensive overview of the history, impact, and 
technical details of ADS-C and its lower layers. Second, we build two 
software-defined radio receivers in order to analyze over 120‚Äô000 
real-world ADS-C messages. We further illustrate ADS-C‚Äôs lack of 
authentication by implementing an ADS-C transmitter, which is capable of
 generating and sending arbitrary ADS-C messages. Finally, we use the 
channel control offered through a software-defined ADS-C receiver and 
transmitter as a basis for an in-depth analysis of the protocol 
weaknesses of the ADS-C system. The found vulnerabilities range from 
passively tracking aircraft to actively altering the position of actual 
aircraft through attacks on the downlink and the uplink. We assess the 
difficulty and impact of these attacks and discuss potential 
countermeasures.</p>
<p>We will further look at satellite-based ADS-B receivers and discuss their security and how they relate to ADS-C.</p><p></p>

<p class="abstract"></p><p>Almost since the internet was made widely 
available to the general public, average technology users have fallen 
prey to threats from malicious spam, malware, phishing, smishing, scams,
 fraud, and ransomware. In most of the US, primary and secondary 
education (in the US, comprising kindergarten through 12th grade) now 
incorporate computing technology as an integral part of the classroom, 
and some families introduce computing platforms to children in their 
toddler and preschool years. Despite our society's growing dependence on
 computing technology in the world of education, there remain no 
national standards or curricula for the teaching of data privacy or 
information security principles. This disconnect sets future generations
 up for failure, and a continuation of a cycle of ignorance that 
perpetuates cybercrime victimization. This presentation makes the case 
that schools must adopt and incorporate concepts of data privacy, 
information security, defense against fraud and phishing, and internet 
safety, in age-appropriate ways, into lesson plans at all grade levels. 
Further, school districts and independent schools must take steps to 
protect themselves from the threat of ransomware, data breaches, and 
other forms of criminal activity. </p><p></p>

<h3 class="talk-title">Inside Dash Cam: Custom Protocols and Discovered 0-days</h3>

  <p class="time-room">Friday at 17:30 in LVCC - L1 - HW3-06-02 (Creator Stage 2)<br>  30 minutes | Exploit ü™≤ </p>

<p class="abstract"></p><p>In recent years, the use of dash cams has 
surged, making them an essential component of modern vehicles. To 
enhance user convenience, many dash cams are now equipped with network 
connectivity. This growth in the dash cam market has heightened the 
importance of vehicle and personal data security. However, 
network-connected dash cams pose potential security risks to their 
availability and key functionalities.  In this presentation, we will 
comprehensively analyze dash cams from various countries, including 
South Korea, the USA, Germany, and China, as well as built-in dash cams.
 During our analysis, we discovered numerous zero-day vulnerabilities 
(such as OS Command Injection, Logical Bugs, and insufficient 
authentication) that pose significant security threats. Vulnerabilities 
were primarily found during the dash cam boot process, configuration 
changes, and communications via custom protocols.</p>
<p>We will detail the dash cam analysis process in the following sequence:</p>
<ul>
<li>[Analysis Process]
<ul>
<li>Acquiring firmware through official websites or apps</li>
<li>Extracting the file system to analyze the initial boot logic</li>
<li>Analyzing the boot logic to identify vulnerabilities or debugging ports to gain shell access</li>
<li>Utilizing the obtained shell for remote debugging of the main system</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Interestingly, our analysis of 10 different dash cams revealed that 4
 devices used the same OEM board from a common manufacturer. These 4 
devices shared similar vulnerabilities, and exploiting a vulnerability 
found in one device allowed us to successfully exploit all of them.  Our
 research uncovered common security vulnerabilities across multiple dash
 cams, and we will discuss measures to prevent these vulnerabilities. We
 will particularly focus on analyzing the custom protocols used by dash 
cams and the security risks associated with them.  This presentation 
aims to raise awareness of potential security threats in dash cams and 
encourage manufacturers to produce more secure products. We hope to 
drive industry standards and best practices to ensure the safety and 
security of these increasingly critical devices.  By sharing our 
findings, we aim to highlight the importance of dash cam security and 
provide insights that can lead to more secure designs and 
implementations.</p><p></p>

<p class="abstract"></p><p>This presentation delves into the intricate 
process of generating a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) for the Bob 
the Minions WiFi router by Davolink‚Äîa device whose firmware isn't 
publicly available. Traditional SBOM creation methods rely on readily 
accessible firmware, but Davolink's restricted release policies 
necessitated an unconventional approach. This talk covers the 
step-by-step journey of hardware disassembly, firmware extraction via 
SPI flash and JTAG/SWD interfaces, and the tools and techniques 
employed. Finally, we'll demonstrate how the recovered firmware is used 
to generate a comprehensive SBOM, highlighting any security 
vulnerabilities discovered and reported to the vendor. This session aims
 to provide attendees with practical insights into overcoming SBOM 
generation challenges in the IoT domain through hands-on hardware 
hacking, and leveraging the firmware and SBOMs for vulnerability 
discovery, as well as security improvement.</p><p></p>

<p class="abstract"></p><p>Ever since the pandemic and the rising 
popularity of work-from-home and hybrid models, there has  been an 
increase in the usage of browsers, particularly video conferencing and 
collaboration applications. While  some extensions enhance the user 
experience, some can gravely affect users' privacy and security. </p>
<p>Over the past few years, extensions have gained recognition for 
nefarious activities, from simple color picker  extensions to 
productivity-first AI extensions. And now more than ever, attackers are 
leveraging malicious  extensions to steal user data, promote ads, 
affiliate marketing, and more. Realizing the abuse, Google pivoted from 
 the MV2 model to the latest MV3, providing better security and locking 
down the extension from running rampant.  While some security measures 
have been introduced in MV3, it is far from safe. In this talk, we will 
be  demonstrating a suite of attacks, while requiring the least amount 
of permissions, which 95% of extensions on the  Chrome store have. We 
will showcase stealth stealing of webcam feed, audio streams, clipboard 
data, and  stealing credentials from other extensions like password 
managers.  </p>
<p>MV3 also introduced security measures to block the usage of functions
 like eval and new Function that allowed  arbitrary code execution. 
We‚Äôll showcase how an extension can still do arbitrary code execution 
effectively  bypassing the MV3 restrictions.  </p>
<p>In this talk, we will also propose changes to the extension security 
model to prevent the lurking loopholes. We will  also be demonstrating 
how malicious extensions can interfere with other extensions and steal 
sensitive  information such as Credit card, passwords, OTP, etc, from 
other extensions. </p><p></p>

<p class="abstract"></p><p>OSINT is a great mechanism for the collection
 of data, but what do you do with all of it once it‚Äôs collected? It can 
take significant time with the human eye to analyze each image or video.
 Furthermore, you may miss important artifacts in the foreground or 
background. Computer vision can churn through the plethora of data to 
pull out the relevant evidence at lightning speed. For the last 5 years 
we‚Äôve been exploring the use of Azure and AWS for computer vision to 
rapidly process large sets of image and video data acquisitions for 
forensic evidence.Through the use of AI we have analyzed thousands of 
images and videos to perform object detection, facial recognition, OCR, 
voice to text analysis, and more. In this session we‚Äôll explore the use 
of cloud platforms to exponentially increase your analysis of uncovering
 key artifacts to your case using demos and real world examples. We then
 apply chronolocation analysis to allow an investigator to paint a 
true-life narrative, for example an individual with a weapon at a 
location at a particular time. We‚Äôll provide live demos of common 
scenarios to reveal benefits to processing your data collections in a 
rapid, efficient, comprehensive, and accurate manner. We‚Äôll then wrap-up
 the presentation with additional AI computer vision recommendations and

<p class="abstract"></p><p>A quarter million people die from Hepatitis C
 yearly, and it's getting worse. But for the first time in history there
 is a cure (not just a treatment) for a virus, and it is for Hepatitis 
C. Take one 400mg pill of Sofosbuvir every day for twelve weeks, and you
 will be free of the virus. The catch? Those pills are $1,000 USD apiece
 because the molecule is the so-called "Intellectual Property" of Gilead
 Pharmaceuticals, and they refuse to share. If you have $84,000 USD, Hep
 C is not your problem. We have developed a way to make the entire 
course of treatment for $300 USD. This methodology also applies to other
 diseases. Like any science, the method of manufacture of drugs can be 
replicated, and we are going to give you all the necessary tools and 
show you the process top-to-bottom. Watch it happen live, participate, 
and learn to do it yourself: Use our digital research assistant to help 
you navigate the scientific literature, get a chemical synthesis 
pathway, generate code for the the MicroLab to run, and watch the 
medicine form in the reaction chamber. Finally, press some tablets. The

 legitimacy. After  touching upon the basics, we'll explore creative 
tactics for obfuscating and hiding QR codes to ensure they reach  their 
intended targets. As a sidetrack, we'll delve into how emails are 
rendered within the Outlook Mail Application  and showcase some neat 
tricks that exploit its limitations for hiding QR codes from modern 
defensive solutions.  Overall, the talk is intended to help testers up 
their QR code phishing game!</p><p></p>

<p class="abstract"></p><p>Home surveillance technology is a modern 
convenience that has been made accessible to the masses through the rise
 of IoT devices, namely cloud-connected Wi-Fi cameras. From parents 
monitoring their infants to homeowners watching their entryways, these 
cameras provide users with access to instant, high definition video from
 the convenience of a mobile phone, tablet, or PC. However, the 
affordability of these devices and relative ease of cloud access 
generally correlates to flawed security, putting users at risk. We set 
out to explore the attack surface of various Wi-Fi camera models to gain
 a deeper understanding of how these devices are being exploited. In the
 end, we devised methods to gain local root access, uncovered user 
privacy issues, discovered a zero-day vulnerability within a prominent 
IoT device management platform that allows attackers to gain remote 
control of millions of cameras worldwide and access sensitive user data,
 and revealed how these devices may be vulnerable to remote code 
execution attacks through completely unauthenticated means thanks to an 
inherently flawed implementation of their underlying peer to peer 
networking protocol. Along with demonstrating our exploits against live 
cameras, we will highlight the methods used to obtain our most 
significant findings and provide guidance on remediating the issues we 
encountered so these devices can be used safely in your household. We 
will also invite audience members to probe and attack a camera during 
our talk and earn a prize in the process!</p><p></p>

<p class="abstract"></p><p>This presentation will be a combination of 
history lesson, technical introduction, and some demonstration. The 
target audience are those who may never had a chance to experience early
 microcomputers but want to get an introduction to the world of ‚Äúretro 
computing.</p>
<p>Today everyone's laptop or smartphone either run an Intel, AMD, or 
ARM processor. And most probably can't tell you exactly what they have 
or know any details of them. It‚Äôs all a black box to most. But back in 
the 70s and 80s, computer hobbyists &amp; hackers knew they had a Z80, 
6502, 6809, 68000 or other processor, and often knew the details and 
could and did program them in assembly. But while the industry has moved
 past the Apple II, Atari 400/800/XL/XE, Commodore 64 et al, there are 
still many who continue to use and enjoy these computers. Even to build 
and create new and exciting items for them as well as brand new systems 
using this old tech.</p>
<p>In this presentation, we will delve into microprocessor history of 
the 8-bit and early 16-bit systems, with a particular focus on the MOS 
6502, one of the most popular microprocessors. We will touch a little on
 the systems that used the 6502, and take a quick look into how to 
program the 6502, even showing a couple of 6502-based systems. 
Importantly for many, we will delve into some of the resources available
 for those wishing to enter this world also.</p><p></p>

<p class="abstract"></p><p>Manufacturing continues to be a top targeted 
sector by cyber threat actors, especially by ransomware. Dragos 2023 
Year In Review showed that 70% of all ransomware victims were 
manufacturers. The Global Resilience Federation Ransomware Report shows 
very similar figures. There are some specific elements that make 
manufacturing a particularly attractive target for ransomware such as 
the lack of network security and segmentation, IT compromise that often 
leads to operational disruption (even if there is not OT network 
intrusion), manufacturing having tight margins, a lack of a compliance

<p>While manufacturing as a whole lags many other critical

that manufacturing has consistently led other industry verticals in, 
automation and device connectivity in the operational technology domain.
 Manufacturer‚Äôs OT network environments increasingly are set up as a 
network or hyper connected IIoT devices, where all data goes to the 
cloud and often comes back from the cloud to offer changes, and all 
participants have access into the OT network domain allowing 
manufacturing to push the boundaries of what products are technically 
possible, what production efficiencies are possible, and how OT 
environments can scale as never before.</p>
<p>This has obviously come with downside risks that manufacturers are 
only now beginning to grapple with and to make meaningful changes to 
better protect their networks and the gains they have made. Their 
growing pains can serve as roadmap of what to do and what not to do as

<p class="abstract"></p><p>Talking to pilots and operators, an important
 aspect of GPS spoofing and jamming is being missed from the narrative 
in the media. We know about position spoofing, that's a given. What 
doesn't appear to be getting much attention is the effect of time 
spoofing.</p>
<p>The most significant of these is an incident where time was spoofed a
 significant period into the future. This caused all digital 
certificates on board an aircraft to become invalid and caused all 
electronic communications to fail. As GPS clocks have protection against
 time being rolled backwards, but not forward, the aircraft was grounded
 for several weeks for systems to be reflashed and the clocks to be 
reset,</p>
<p>Coarse time spoofing could therefore ground entire fleets. We'll 
discuss this and potential mitigations. If time allows, we could touch

<h4 class="speaker"><span class="speaker-affiliation">on behalf of Policy Village</span></h4>

<p class="abstract"></p><p>Clean Energy technology, while essential for 
the energy transition, often utilizes components sourced from 
adversarial countries, potentially increasing cyber vulnerabilities, 
especially in systems managed by smaller utilities with limited 
cybersecurity expertise.  The previous approaches of 'rip and replace' 
to eliminate foreign components have proved inadequate and if applied to
 clean energy, may be economically and technically destabilizing.</p>
<p>This policy session will also delve into the broader implications of a
 digitalized supply chain, where simplistic views of cybersecurity do 
not suffice. Instead, a nuanced understanding of the operational and 
physical realities of energy systems is essential. By discussing how to 
balance immediate economic pressures against long-term sustainability 
and security, the session aims to foster a more informed and effective 
policy discourse.</p>
<p>In summary, as the energy sector evolves to include diverse 
infrastructure systems‚Äîranging from hospitals to military 
installations‚Äîthe need for a robust, informed, and agile policy approach
 to cybersecurity becomes increasingly critical. This session will 
provide a platform for critical discourse to ensure that the transition 
to renewable energy is both secure and sustainable, aligning climate 
goals with national security imperatives</p><p></p>

<h4 class="speaker"><span class="speaker-affiliation">on behalf of Aerospace Village</span></h4>

<p class="abstract"></p><p>As a pilot and cybersecurity researcher, I am
 very interested of the nexus between aviation and security. To explore 
this interest, I developed a device called Fly Catcher - a device that 
detects for aircraft spoofing by monitoring for malicious ADS-B signals 
in the 1090MHz frequency.  The device consists of a 1090 MHz antenna, a 
Flight Aware RTL SDR, a custom 3D printed case, a portable battery 
charger, and a MicroUSB cable.</p>
<p>The device receives ADS-B information from the antenna and the 
software-defined radio, which is then passed into a Convolutional Neural
 Network written with Python to detect whether or not the aircraft is 
spoofed. I trained the neural network on a dataset of valid ADS-B 
signals as well as a generated spoofed set of aircraft signals, to teach
 Fly Catcher how to detect and flag any suspicious ADS-B signals. It 
does this by checking for discrepancies in the signal's characteristics,
 such as its location, velocity, and identification.</p>
<p>The result outputted by the neural network is then displayed onto a 
radar screen allowing users to detect spoofed aircraft near them. To 
test the device, I brought it with me for an hour-long flight to scan 
for a wide variety of aircraft enroute. After the flight, the data was 
fed into the Neural Network to analyze any spoofed aircraft I might have
 encountered.</p><p></p>

 (TCAS) II has been touted as a foolproof safety net since its 
introduction in the 1980s. But what if we told you that this supposedly 
impenetrable system can be compromised? For years, attacks on TCAS have 
been mere theoretical exercises, foiled by an (accidental) built in

<p class="abstract"></p><p>As security researchers, we constantly 
attempt to stay ahead of the curve, seeking innovative solutions to 
enhance our offensive security strategies. In recent years, the advent 
of artificial intelligence (AI) has introduced a new dimension to our 
efforts, particularly in the realm of bug bounties and pentesting. While
 significant attention has been given to understanding and mitigating 
attacks against AI systems, the potential of AI to assist in the 
offensive security field remains largely unclear.</p>
<p>This talk pretends to dig into the research and development process 
undertaken to create an AI agent designed to augment the bug bounty and 
pentesting workflow. Our AI agent is not merely a theoretical concept 
but a practical tool aimed at enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness
 of security researchers.</p>
<p>We have conducted extensive research to understand how AI can mimic 
and enhance human intuition and creativity in identifying 
vulnerabilities. While this may sound trivial, there is little evidence 
of this being tested before on generative AI agents. Our work breaks new
 ground by pushing the boundaries of what AI can achieve in offensive 
security. </p>
<p>Will AI become an indispensable tool in our arsenal, capable of 
autonomously identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities? Join us as we 
explore the possibilities and implications of AI as an offensive 
assistant in this new era of offensive security.</p><p></p>

<p class="abstract"></p><p>Were you ever wondering why a vacuum robot or
 a smart air purifier needs multiple cameras and microphones? How secure
 are these devices? Can the devices be used to potentially spy on you?</p>
<p>For the past 5 years we have been presenting ways to hack and root 
vacuum robots at various events like the c3 or the DEFCON. In all these 
cases it covered vacuum robots by Roborock, Dreame, Xiaomi and some 
smaller companies. However, did we ever take a look at other vendors and
 maybe some new interesting device classes? In this talk we do exactly 
that, and will take a deep dive into Ecovacs robots! Ecovacs is the 
current market leader for smart home robots and recently expanded in 
other areas of home robotics.</p>
<p>You will be surprised how many worrisome things we found: broken 
crypto, missing TLS certificate verification, honor-system based ACLs, 
lots of RCEs, broken factory resets and unauthorized live camera access.</p>
<p>We will discuss our and other researchers experience with reporting 
bugs to the company and why one cannot trust third party certification 
agencies. In regard to trust, we will also address why you need to be 
careful with the choice of your spouse or flatmates.</p>
<p>Come with us on a journey of having fun hacking interesting devices 
while exploring bad oversights, real problems and the ignorance of the 
manufacturer. Learn what ways there are to root these devices and to use
 them in a privacy-preserving way.</p><p></p>

<p class="abstract"></p><p>Over the past decade, infotainment systems 
experienced a growth in functionality, broader adoption and central 
incorporation into the vehicle architecture. Due to the ever-growing 
role of wireless protocols such as Bluetooth and a known lack of patches
 alongside the difficulty of patch installation, this poses a new attack
 surface and a genuine threat to the users. At the same time, the tools 
and methodologies required for testing are scattered across the 
Internet, absent and need a rigorous setup.</p>
<p>In this talk, we share a comprehensive framework BlueToolkit to test 
and replay Bluetooth Classic vulnerabilities. We provide practical 
information and tips. Additionally, we release new exploits and a 
privilege escalation attack vector.</p>
<p>We show how we used the toolkit to find 64 new vulnerabilities in 22 
modern cars and the Garmin Flight Stream flight management system used 
in several aircraft types.</p>
<p>Our work equips Bluetooth hackers with necessary information on novel
 implementation-specific vulnerabilities that could be used to steal 
information from target cars, establish MitM position or escalate 
privileges to hijack victims‚Äô accounts stealthily.</p>

vulnerabilities and making Bluetooth research more accessible and

  <p class="time-room">Saturday at 16:30 in LVCC - L1 - HW3-06-02 (Creator Stage 2)<br>  30 minutes | Exploit ü™≤ </p>

  <h4 class="speaker">Andrzej Olchawa </h4>
<h4 class="speaker"><span class="speaker-affiliation">on behalf of Aerospace Village</span></h4>

<p class="abstract"></p><p>Every space mission is underpinned by 
critical software that spacecraft operators utilize to monitor and 
command their assets. The Mission Control System serves as the primary 
interface with a spacecraft, marking it as a crucial component of the 
ground segment. For decades, these systems were operated exclusively 
within the confines of mission control rooms, accessible only to a 
select group of individuals through a limited number of computer 
workstations. This paradigm has recently shifted, with numerous space 
organizations enabling their personnel to manage space assets remotely, 
including from the comfort of their homes. This increased accessibility 
has rendered space-related systems susceptible to the same security 
vulnerabilities that affect our daily-use software.</p>
<p>Despite the adoption of newer technology stacks in many mission 
control systems‚Äîeither through upgrades or complete replacements‚Äîthe 
consideration of security requirements has often been deferred to the 
final stages of development or overlooked entirely. This negligence 
presents a significant risk, exposing the space sector to potential 
exploitation by malicious entities. Like in other technology domains, 
merely expanding strategies to incorporate security measures, 
instituting security policies, and integrating new security requirements
 are positive but insufficient. Despite being developed and tested by 
extensive teams and presumably adhering to best practices, we have 
observed firsthand how contemporary mission control systems remain prone
 to elementary security flaws.</p>
<p>The most effective strategy to equip space systems with a robust 
defense against malicious actors involves integrating offensive security
 testing throughout their development lifecycle.</p>
<p>In this presentation, we share the results of the security research 
we have recently conducted on the more established, open-source Mission 
Control Systems: NASA OpenMCT and YaMCS. We present the details of the 
vulnerabilities we have discovered in those two systems, and their 
potential impact on a space mission when they are chained together into 
one exploit. We conclude by presenting with the audience the lessons 
learned from those security assessments.</p><p></p>

<p class="abstract"></p><p>As the adoption of GenAI tools has soared, 
security has done little to keep up. New classes of data, and especially
 vector data, is flooding into new and untested data stores. Vector 
databases are getting copies of health data, financial data, HR data, 
emails, and everything else, but they have no intrinsic security. What's
 worse, the vectors themselves can be reversed in embedding inversion 
attacks that turn those vectors back into faces, sentences, and even 
pictures. We discuss these new attacks and a new branch of cryptography,
 vector encryption, which allows for privacy preserving searches to 
happen over the encrypted vectors. We'll discuss the benefits, 
trade-offs, and current state of the field and the open source software 
we've built to meet the new need.</p><p></p>

  <h4 class="speaker">Jeff Man </h4>
<h4 class="speaker"><span class="speaker-affiliation">on behalf of Crypto Privacy Village</span></h4>

<p class="abstract"></p><p>I recently googled the meaning of 
‚Äúencryption‚Äù and found this definition on Wikipedia: ‚ÄúIn cryptography, 
encryption is the process of encoding information. This process converts
 the original representation of the information, known as plaintext, 
into an alternative form known as ciphertext.‚Äù Um‚Ä¶no, encoding produces 
code, enciphering produces ciphertext, encryption is more than just 
encoding, and so on. Given the jumbling together of historically very 
unique and significant terminology I set out to find the actual, 
historical definitions and try to find a way to teach and/or demonstrate
 the differences in the foundational forms of cryptography. But I 
quickly noticed that some of this terminology is so often mis-applied in
 our digital age that I wondered if maybe there has been an evolution of
 the meanings of these terms? I might not like it, but I‚Äôm open to that 
possibility. This very quickly led me to the conclusion that my research
 on this topic would make for an interesting talk and so here we are. I 
want to share the classical, historical forms of cryptography, discuss 
the etymology of the terminology, look at how the words apply today ‚Äì 
and help the audience decide if the actual meanings even matter (or it‚Äôs
 just me). One important consideration is the tradeoff between keeping 
the data secret (security) and protecting the identity of individuals 
associated with the data (privacy). I hope you‚Äôll join me in this 
journey to victory (or defeat) in the ongoing battle of preserving the 
classic goals and objectives of data security.</p><p></p>

<p class="abstract"></p><p>Advanced attackers are increasingly choosing 
edge devices as targets, many of which are security appliances such as 
VPNs and Firewalls. They run closed-source firmware, and defenders and 
researchers must understand it to assess its security and integrity. We 
faced this firsthand when a client that used Draytek equipment was 
compromised. With at least 500k Draytek routers exposed to the Internet 
globally, no working tools exist to extract their firmware and assist 
researchers and defenders working with them.</p>
<p>We reverse-engineered Draytek's firmware format, developed tools to 
extract it, and discovered that its RTOS kernel can load code modules 
dynamically. These stored modules remain active even after firmware 
upgrades, inadvertently facilitating persistent threats. We crafted and 
uploaded malicious modules using our tools and newly found 
vulnerabilities to achieve persistence.</p>
<p>End-users lack straightforward means to detect such compromises. In 
response to this threat, we developed our own module to assess the 
integrity of other modules loaded in memory, mitigating its impact. In 
our pursuit of a more secure internet, we are sharing our knowledge and 
opening our tools to the community, enabling observability, hardening, 
transparency, and vulnerability research on Draytek edge devices.</p><p></p>

<p class="abstract"></p><p>So your organization decided to follow the 
trend and switched to Kubernetes for hosting their  applications. And 
this means that the mission for the SOC, has now changed from monitoring
 servers and  networks, to building detective capability for a container

TTPs? What attack signatures should you alert upon, and what logs are 
there to look for in first place? </p>
<p>A similar challenge arises for the offensive security practitioner: 
What strategies exist for performing continuous  Kubernetes threat 
emulation? Infrastructure technologies have changed rapidly, and 
adversaries have adapted.  Despite the novelty of attack surface, 
insider threats still remain relevant, and prevention alone is not 
enough to  manage the risk posed to the modern enterprise. </p>

<p class="abstract"></p><p>Safety has been at the forefront of Civil 
Aviation since the formalization of DO-178, Software Considerations in 
Airborne Systems and Equipment Certification, in 1981. However, times 
have changed since then and we live in a world with seemingly limitless 
connectivity. DO-356A, Airworthiness Security Methods and 
Considerations, forms the cybersecurity bedrock in which aviation 
systems are designed and implemented. In this talk, participants will 
learn about how Safety and Security is applied to system design and how 
they interact with one another. Design Assurance Levels (DAL) and 
Security Assurance Levels (SAL) concepts are presented and explained 
what their purpose is. This talk is designed to appeal to the general 
cybersecurity community by introducing fundamentals of Safety analyses 
and discussing how Safety and Security interact with one another.</p>
<p>This talk will first touch upon fundamental documents that form the 
Certification basis for System Development (ARP4754B), System Safety 
(ARP4761A), and Security Considerations (DO-356A). From there, it walk 
through pieces that form a safety analysis and Design Assurance Level 
(DAL), walk through a system architecture under consideration, and learn
 about how Safety and requirements in a system can be used to inform the
 Threat Model for the system. From there, we end with a discussion on 
how Security Mitigations are assigned Security Assurance Level (SAL) and
 what this means for developers.</p><p></p>

<p class="abstract"></p><p>From January to May 2024, a team of student 
researchers at Brigham Young University looked for 0days in a 
consumer-grade home router made by Vilo Living. By April 2024, they had 
found 9 zero days, 6 of which were critical. This presentation covers 
the process they went through from initial reconnaissance to hardware 
hacking to finding buffer overflows to reporting the bugs to the 
organization.  Outline: Initial recon - OSINT on the company, previous 
vulnerabilities released (none), and black-box interactions with network
 services on the LAN Hardware hacking - identifying chips on the board, 
connecting to the UART interface, deciphering boot up info, dumping the 
flash memory (didn‚Äôt work), and observing reads/writes by the CPU to 
flash memory to obtain the firmware Cloud enumeration - discovering the 
AWS S3 buckets and IoT infrastructure, tracing cloud interactions 
(authenticating to the router remotely, retrieving MQTT certificates, 
etc.) Firmware enumeration - kernel + libc version, arch, how to emulate
 binaries on an x86 machine, compiling code to run on the router, what 
binary does what, etc. Vulnerability discovery - finishing reversing 
custom TCP protocol for mobile app-&gt;router interactions, searching 
for stack overflows, lack of authentication, command injection (and 
accidentally bricking 3 routers), info leaks, reviewing the 9 
vulnerabilities we discovered, weaponizing and chaining some of the 
vulnerabilities, etc. Vendor disclosure - difficulty contacting the 
vendor in May 2024 with vulnerability details (they were almost dead), 
how the disclosure process went, filing for CVEs in June, publishing 
vuln details in August Conclusion - how stupid easy it is to hack IoT 
devices, how IoT vendors treat security issues, where future research 
can focus</p><p></p>

<p class="abstract"></p><p>On February 25, 1998, hip-hop group the 
Wu-Tang Clan made Grammy history‚Ä¶ for all the wrong reasons. After 
losing in the Rap Album of the Year category, Wu-Tang member ODB stormed
 the stage, interrupting an acceptance speech to declare the now 
infamous phrase ‚ÄúWu-Tang is for the children.‚Äù Anyone who has heard a 
song from Wu-Tang knows that despite ODB‚Äôs insistence, it is certainly 
not true. It appears that States may be taking this same approach when 
it comes to children's privacy and safety online. Despite these laws 
being for the protection of children, they often raise other unintended 
consequences. State legislatures around the country are debating new 
laws to protect children online. This year, Tennessee, Maryland, 
Virginia, Georgia, Utah, and Florida have passed legislation focused on 
children's privacy, usually through restrictions on social media use. 
While privacy advocates have championed these laws, they have been met 
with criticism and, in some instances, legal challenges. This is because
 in order to implement laws that apply to kids online, companies have to
 identify which users are kids‚Äîwhich requires the collection of 
sensitive personal information. Along with this privacy tension, there 
are First Amendment protection concerns that these laws limit online 
speech. This presentation will explore how youth privacy laws may not be
 protecting children in the ways that we hope by first discussing the 
attempts made by states to address youth privacy. Then, analyzing the 
unintended privacy consequences, focusing on how states are required to 
collect sensitive information that we are often trying to protect. Next,
 we will examine the First Amendment concerns using the example of the 
challenges to California‚Äôs Age Appropriate Design Code Act before 
finally discussing a path forward to protecting children.</p><p></p>
